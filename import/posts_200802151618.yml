    title: "Putting The 'Backward' in 'Backward Compatibility'"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which Microsoft is dumb."
    body: "So some recent decisions and announcements by Microsoft's Internet Explorer team regarding how standards-compliant rendering will work in the forthcoming IE 8.0 has sparked a big discussion on these internets of ours about whether `DOCTYPE` switching &mdash; up to now the only way to force IE to even _try_ to render pages correctly &mdash; is the same thing as browser sniffing, and whether the IE 8 team's proposed \"solution\" is or is not stupid.\n\nBefore you keep reading (and before I keep writing), let's all get up to speed by catching up on the discussion:\n\n* [Beyond DOCTYPE: Web Standards, Forward Compatibility, and IE8](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype) and [From Switches to Targets: A Standardista's Journey](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fromswitchestotargets) on [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/)\n* [Standards mode is the new quirks mode](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200801/standards_mode_is_the_new_quirks_mode/) on 456 Berea St.\n* [Versioning, Compatibility and Standards](http://webkit.org/blog/155/versioning-compatibility-and-standards/) on the WebKit project's Surfin' Safari blog.\n\nJust to give you the nickel tour of the issue: Microsoft developers, being a pack of craven, cowardly nincompoops who wouldn't know innovation if it walked into Steve Ballmer's office and did an interpretive dance, have committed themselves to maintaining backward compatibility in IE 8 for any web site authored for IEs 6 and 7. On the one hand, this is admirable. After all, for many non-technical users (grandmothers, office workers, my trainer) IE really _is_ the web, and they're the folks least likely to understand that a web site they use every day is broken because its code was written for a browser older than the War on Terror.\n\nOn the other hand, if the IE team is in agreement that standards are good and the way to go for the future, why are they encouraging nearly a decade's worth of lazy code and practices by continuing to support them? The obvious reason is that Microsoft's core business is catering to large enterprises, who've invested billions of dollars building web-based applications on the IE platform and would be upset if those apps suddenly quit working because a bunch of nerds decided in between _Magic_ tournaments that CSS padding should make a box wider, not narrower.\n\nAnyway, I digress. The real concern behind what we're talking about is not (just) IE 6 quirks mode, which deserves to be left on the ash heap of history, but also the flawed \"standards\" modes in IE 6 and 7 which have caused web developers to spend millions of hours researching and using hacks and workarounds to make Microsoft's browser behave. If IE 8 were to apply its standards mode the same way IE 7 does (via `DOCTYPE` switching), it's likely that any IE hacks present on a given site would cause it to break.\n\nSo the IE 8 team, in consultation with the Web Standards Project, have come up with a \"sweet\" (in the sense of iPhone web apps, that is, not at all) solution: requiring web page authors to include a `META` tag _specifying which version of IE their site should work on_ in order to activate standards-compliant rendering.\n\nFirst, to get down to brass tacks: _yes_, it is good that IE 8 has passed the Acid2 test and will most likely render my web sites the way I intended, the same way they render in Safari 3, Firefox 3 and Opera. And if a one-line `META` tag is what I need to make that work, I'm down with that. Standards are good. Standards are great. Yay standards.\n\n_However_, let's just step back a moment and return to the true nitpicky issue here: why is it _my_ problem that Microsoft's idiot customers locked themselves into IE 6's grotesque interpretation of HTML and CSS?\n\nStandards should be adhered to not because they work a certain way in a certain version of a certain browser, but because they're _standards_. Smart web developers don't put `DOCTYPE`s on their web pages just to activate IE's standards mode; they do it because it's part of the HTML/XHTML specification and it helps user agents understand how to interpret the document. And yes, triggering standards mode is part of that, but it's not the only part nor the most important.\n\nWhen you write broken code, things should break, or else you have no incentive to write non-broken code. Microsoft is trying to make bad rendering the permanent default behavior for Internet Explorer, by forcing anyone who wants standards to opt into them. Meanwhile, they continue to make it difficult (if not impossible) to run older IE releases concurrently with new ones on the same machine, so you can't just tell someone to install and run IE 6 if they need to use a site with some deprecated code.\n\nHere's a brain-teaser for you: if you have to add a harmless-but-unusual `META` tag to standards-compliant HTML code to make it work properly in one or more browsers, is the code still standards-compliant? Technically the answer would be yes, since the `META` tag is part of all the current HTML specifications and the proposed `X-UA-Compatible` header would be harmlessly ignored by browsers that don't support it.\n\nBut you could hardly say the _browser_ is standards-compliant. Unless I'm remembering wrong, the XHTML and CSS specs do not say I need to send a certain HTTP header or `META` tag for my code to be interpreted correctly. Sure, IE 8 may be able to pass the Acid2 test after it's received that special header, which means it ought to be able to passably render web pages I wrote for Safari 2 _two years ago_. But calling it a standards-compliant browser is a bit of a stretch."

    title: "If An Oscars Game Falls In The Forest..."
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we realize we've forgotten something important."
    body: "You may not know this, but every year for as long as I can remember this site has held [a little Oscars prediction context](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) for which the prize has been bragging rights and often a gift certificate or physical object that I inevitably forget to mail.\n\nI mention it because this year, my Oscars Game-related amnesia has expanded to cover the game itself. In other words, [the Oscar nominations were announced this morning](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/movies/awardsseason/23oscarscnd.html) and I _just realized like five minutes ago_ I've completely forgotten to write an Oscars Game web app for this year. _Like, OMFG._\n\nThe Oscars Game is a funny sort of tradition around here: there are maybe six or seven diehards who come back to play every year, plus anywhere from a dozen to two or three dozen people who hear about the game from [other](http://coudal.com/) [places](http://project.ioni.st/) and check it out. But it's one of those traditions that, like black eyed peas on New Year's or Republicans winning Presidential elections, I'm not sure the observants would miss if it were gone.\n\nFor my part, the Oscars Game has served a couple of useful purposes. The 2005 Oscars Game was the first Rails app I ever wrote, the 2006 edition was the first site I did with serious Ajax, and last year's was the first time I'd ever had to scale a Rails app so it wouldn't crash every five minutes. Before that, the O.G. was my excuse to try out new PHP tricks and whatever layout ideas I hadn't been able to use on a real project.\n\nThis year I'm kind of a Rails and Ajax wizard, and my recent projects have presented a lot of nice visual and usability challenges. I'm not feeling like I have any untapped ideas that make an Oscars Game really worth building, so we're left with the community aspect. Though I will admit that if I didn't find myself on January 22 with two projects on my desk, this year's Oscars Game would have featured (and may still feature) some of the following techniques and technologies I've been interested in:\n\n* [jQuery](http://errtheblog.com/posts/73-the-jskinny-on-jquery), either in addition or instead of [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/).\n\n* The Facebook Platform, aka the gobbledegook that allows assholes like me to allow assholes like you to pelt each other with \"Zombie invitations,\" \"compare me requests\", \"movie quizzes\" and \"Scrabulous challenges.\"\n\n* [OpenID](http://openid.net/) logins, so you can use your LiveJournal/Vox/AIM/Yahoo accounts to sign in. Actually, now that there's a great first-party Rails plugin for OpenID authentication, this is probably a must-have.\n\n* A little design idea I've used on a couple recent projects I like to call \"Comments Freaking Everywhere,\" where users could add their own comments to any Movie, Nominee or Category in the system.\n\n_All that being said,_ I do have last year's code which &mdash; with a little cleaning up and porting to Rails 2.0 &mdash; can be back up and running and ready for predictiosity in mere days.\n\nSo let's gauge some interest. If you'd like to see the Oscars Game return in 2008, shoot me an e-mail at <david@practicalmadness.com>. And if you do, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:\n\n* Did you play the Oscars Game in 2007 or any previous year?\n\n* If you played in 2007, would you want to re-use your username/password from last year? Put another way: would you be terribly offended if I made you sign up again?\n\n* Also, if you played before, what did you think of the experience? Any complaints or (better still) massive amounts of praise? Any feature requests?\n\n* Would you be interested in playing the Oscars Game as a Facebook app?"

    title: "Stupid Apache Tricks"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we make a certain webserver our bitch."
    body: "First off, let me briefly apologize to anyone who clicked through to this article expecting to see pictures of <del>Indians</del> <ins>Native Americans</ins> performing bizarre stunts such as swallowing goldfish, fighting the noble polar bear or drinking entire cans of Lysol and surviving to tell the tale while really, really high. On Lysol.\n\nThis article, rather, is about the [Apache webserver](http://httpd.apache.org/), an open-source workhorse that powers many of the sites you enjoy on the intarwebs each and every day. Like that site with [the adorable kittens with really poor grammar](http://www.icanhascheezburger.com/). Or more importantly, the [BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/). Or most importantly, _this_ website.\n\nFellow nerds who, like your humble narrator, are engaged in the practice of developing websites for the continued awesomeness of these great internets of ours may find great value in the content to follow. This tutorial may be of particular interest to practitioners of something I shall refer to as \"[Rails development](http://www.rubyonrails.org/),\" which (believe it or not!) has everything to do with websites and nothing to do with trains.\n\nFor you see, it has been my experience that while there have been several blog posts, articles, wiki pages, mailing list threads, mash notes and carrier pigeon-borne field manuals written on the topic of setting up a local webserver for the purposes of developing websites, there is currently _no_ writing on the subject of how _my_ local Apache environment is set up. And as I find my webserver setup to be elegant, useful and thoughtfully organized, I think it is well past time I get up on my high horse and tell you people how it's done.\n\nIn short: if you are not a web developer you will want to [get out while you still can.](http://icanhascheezburger.com/?random#top) For _serious nerdery_ follows after the jump."
    extended: "### Rolling Yer Own Apache ###\n\nFirst off, let me say that building Apache 2.2.x is one of my least favorite things in the universe, but I find it on balance to be way simpler and easier than the alternative, which is teaching [Mac OS X Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)'s bundled Apache install to do what I want it to do. I'm generally the kind of anal-retentive malcontent who installs things from source, so if that's not your particular cup of tea, you can skip down to [the section on configuration](#im_in_ur_configs) provided you've already got a usable Apache install, or a non-source way to install one (such as apt-get or MacPorts).\n\nLeopard does ship with Apache 2.2.6 preinstalled, but with an odd, incomplete configuration that's optimized for some of OS X's built-in Web Sharing magic, which personally I can do without. (Though if you happen to use Web Sharing for anything important, please note that rolling your own Apache will require that you disable Web Sharing, at least while your custom-built server is running.) So let's build our own Apache from scratch.\n\nJust so you know, we're gonna be installing our new stuff in `/usr/local`. You can [read Dan Benjamin's blog post about why this is a good idea](http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/using_usr_local), or you can just trust me that this is a good idea.\n\nAlso, **you will need to install Apple's Xcode developer tools before going any further**. (Obviously, if you've already installed Xcode you're ready to rock.) If you (like me) are a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) user, I also strongly recommend installing the `mate` command line tool so you can invoke TextMate's ninja-like editing power from the Terminal.\n\n### Building Apache ###\n\nFirst, let's create a folder in our home directory and `cd` into that new folder. This will be our workspace for all our downloading and compiling needs. (You can delete this folder after we're done, if you want.)\n\n<pre>mkdir -p ~/src\ncd ~/src</pre>\n\nNext, we need to download and unzip a current copy of the Apache source code:\n\n<pre>curl -O http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/pub/software/apache/httpd/httpd-2.2.6.tar.gz\ntar xzvf httpd-2.2.6.tar.gz\ncd httpd-2.2.6</pre>\n\nThen we'll need to configure our Apache install. We're going to tell it to install into `/usr/local/apache2`, and to include a fairly typical set of modules, including `mod_proxy`, `mod_rewrite` and SSL support. If you need any modules other than the ones listed here, feel free to season this to taste. I find that pretty much any module I need (apart from the ones specifically listed) is covered by the `--enable-module=most` directive.\n\n<pre>./configure \\\n--prefix=/usr/local/apache2 \\\n--enable-module=most \\\n--enable-shared=max \\\n--with-mpm=prefork --enable-ssl \\\n--enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http \\\n--enable-rewrite \\\n--enable-headers</pre>\n\nNext we compile...(this part may take a while)\n\n<pre>make</pre>\n\nAnd when that finishes, we install:\n\n<pre>sudo make install</pre>\n\n\n### Clearing a PATH ###\n\nAnd when _that_ finishes, we're done, right?\n\nWell, pretty much. We've installed Apache 2.2.6, and it should be ready to start up. But our Apache is, as I said, in `/usr/local/apache2/bin`, and unless you want to type that whole path to the Apache command line tools every time you start or stop your server, you'll want to add Apache to your `PATH`.\n\nTo do this, edit your user's `.bash_profile` file by typing the following command (if you don't have TextMate, you can use `vi`, `emacs` or whatever other editor you prefer):\n\n<pre>mate ~/.bash_login</pre>\n\nThis will open the file if it already exists, or open a blank file if it doesn&rsquo;t. Add the following line at the very end of the file:\n\n<pre>export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/apache2/bin:\$PATH\"</pre>\n\nNow save and close the file. Then, to make sure the changes are picked up by the shell, execute the file:\n\n<pre>. ~/.bash_login</pre>\n\nAt this point, when you run the command `which apachectl` (i.e., asking where the `apachectl` program is, if installed), it should return `/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl`.\n\nIf it says anything other than that, you did something wrong. Likewise, if you ran into any errors during the process, you probably did something wrong. Like, you know, not installing Xcode like I told you to.\n\nBut I know you, Gentle Reader, and I know you wouldn't make such foolish, careless mistakes. So I will from this point on assume that you are now the proud installer and maintainer of your own custom-built Apache 2.2.6.\n\nSo onward to configuration!<a name=\"im_in_ur_configs\">&nbsp;</a>\n\n\n### I'm In Ur httpd.confs, Confing Ur Httpds ###\n\n<p style=\"float:right;margin:1em\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071205/apache_conf.png\" alt=\"David's Apache conf directory structure\"></p>\n\nFirst off, why don't you [take a peek at my `httpd.conf` file](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071205/httpd.conf.txt)? \n\nNow let's talk about structure, specifically that of your newly created `/usr/local/apache2/conf` directory which contains all of your various `.conf` files. I'm pretty sure the `original` and `extra` folders are created as part of the default install. If I sound unsure it's because I never use those.\n\nYou can see an image of my `conf` directory layout here on the right. I always create three subdirectories in there:\n\n* <strong>includes</strong>: This is for bits of reusable/repetitive configuration, like enabling SSL or specifying rewrite rules for a given Rails application. Basically these `.conf`s are pre-defined _behaviors_, which I can drop into a `VirtualHost` or the main server config with a simple include statement, such as\n\n\t`Include conf/includes/generic_ssl.conf`\n\n* <strong>ssl</strong>: This stores all my local SSL certificates (which are all self-signed). We'll talk about this folder more in just a moment.\n\n* <strong>vhosts</strong>: If I may direct your attention to the last line of my `httpd.conf`, you'll note that there's a couple of `NameVirtualHost` directives (for my local IP, on ports 80 and 443) and a wildcarded `Include` directive which basically slurps in every file in the `conf/vhosts` folder. Rather than having one enormous config file in which I define every single virtual host and configure every single server feature, I prefer to split my vhosts into separate config files by project. For example, `t26.conf` contains the two `VirtualHost` blocks (one secured, one not) for my local dev environment for [T-26](http://www.t26.com/).\n\nI find that 90% of the configuration business I do with my local Apache revolves around vhosts, so let's talk a bit more about this `VirtualHost` business, shall we?\n\n### Virtual Insanity ###\n\nIf you take a look at [the vhost conf file for a current project of mine](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071205/mim.conf.txt), you'll notice right off the bat that even though this is a local Apache install, I'm using a real domain name &mdash; `mim.local.practical.cc`.\n\nI host and self-manage the DNS for `practical.cc` at [DNS Made Easy](http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/), and to hook this up I created an A record for `*.local.practical.cc`, pointing to 127.0.0.1. It's a wildcard, enabling me to create an unlimited number of local hostnames for all my many projects.\n\nNot only is this convenient and easy to set up, it allows me to maintain a naming convention for all my various project sites and resources. For example, I have a similar wildcard set up for `*.beta.practical.cc`, which points to a similar Apache/Mongrel hosting environment on my demo server. There's also `*.dev.practical.cc`, which maps to the [Warehouse SVN browser](http://warehouseapp.com/) for a given project. The wildcard for each of these URLs is the project's \"short name\" (\"mim\"), which is also the name of the Rails app folder (both locally and online), the prefix for its database names (e.g. `mim_production`), the name of its SVN repository and &mdash; of course &mdash; the name of its `.conf` file in Apache.\n\nI use virtual hosts pretty much only for Rails apps, and I have a fairly standard configuration template I use for proxying Apache requests over to Mongrel processes. You can [check out the rewrite rules for the `mim` project here](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071205/mim_rewrite.conf.txt). With the obvious exceptions of the port number and the location of the log file, the rewrite rules are the same for every project.\n\nThe rewrite rules live in their own project-specific `.conf` file, which lives in `conf/includes` and is slurped into the app's virtual host config via the `Include` directive. I happen to like the shorter, cleaner configuration this approach yields, but the real reason for this is way more important: it keeps me from having to write the same rewrite rules twice when I set up the SSL version of a given app.\n\n### Warm, Secure and DRY ###\n\nAh, SSL &mdash; we can't live with you, yet we can't live without you. A full, detailed discussion of all the ins and outs of server security is way, _way_ beyond the scope of this writing. My interest here is rather just to show you how I address my primary SSL need on my local Apache install, namely setting up and testing Rails's `ssl_requirement` plugin in my clients' apps.\n\nLet me tell you a couple things about self-signed certificates. A self-signed certificate is just like the expiring, \$20+ per year \"real\" certificates you would buy from a \"Certificate Authority\" such as Verisign or GoDaddy in all but two respects:\n\n* You, while lovely and brilliant to be sure, are not a Certificate Authority. So your self-signed certificates will cause browsers to throw up a nasty warning dialog at least once per session. Once you've accepted the certificate, the browser will behave normally.\n\n* It's free. Which is a good damn thing, since what we're going to want here is a wildcard certificate (to go with our wildcard domain), which usually retails for \$200 or more at even a bargain-basement CA like GoDaddy.\n\nRather than bore you with another long series of Terminal commands, I'll just direct you to [this short, sweet tutorial on creating self-signed certificates](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html). The only things I did differently from these instructions were:\n\n* To make the wildcard URLs work, I entered `*.local.practical.cc` as my domain name.\n\n* Instead of `server.*` for all the filenames, I used `localhost.*`. (I may at some point need or want to use a separate certificate, perhaps even a _real_ certificate from a CA, on my local machine, so the nomenclature helps specify which certs are for which hosts.)\n\n* On Step 4, \"Generating a Self-Signed Certificate,\" openssl on my Mac threw some kind of random number error. But it did generate a usable `.crt` file, so I ignored it and everything works fine.\n\nThere are a couple lines of SSL configuration back in `httpd.conf`, but most of the magic happens in [my generic SSL configuration include](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071205/generic_ssl.conf.txt), a 14-line file which enables SSL for the current domain/vhost, specifies my wildcarded certificate and public key files, and &mdash; importantly, for Rails apps &mdash; sets the `X_FORWARDED_PROTO` header Rails needs to distinguish proxied requests as having come from an `https` request rather than plain old `http`.\n\nI can then include this file into any of my secure `VirtualHosts` (the ones listening on `127.0.0.1:443`) that have `ServerName`s set to one of my `*.local.practical.cc` domains, thus enabling local SSL in one line of code.\n\n\n### More Stupid Apache Tricks ###\n\nI think I mentioned at least once that _real_ security matters and production server setup were beyond the scope of this article, and they are. But there are a couple of little moves I've picked up recently that have been super-helpful.\n\nAnyone who's fumbled around with Apache virtual hosting for a while probably knows that once `NameVirtualHost` is enabled, Apache basically starts ignoring its default configuration and instead relies on your various `VirtualHost` blocks to determine which content to serve for a given request. Generally, for a current project, this will behave as expected &mdash; you'll have a vhost for the project, and Apache will serve up that site.\n\nOccasionally, however, you'll (that's to say, _I'll_) have someone &mdash; like the Googlebot &mdash; try to navigate to a disused project URL, which will annoy the visitor at best or throw up a mess of crazy Rails exceptions at worst.\n\nSo after I moved [the Practical Creative &amp; Code site](http://practical.cc/) to my [Blue Box](http://www.blueboxgrp.com/) VPS late last week, I decided to add a couple of rules to gracefully handle outdated requests.\n\nHere's the `VirtualHost` block for `practical.cc` (which, I should mention, is a simple static site, not a Rails app):\n\n<pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n  DocumentRoot /home/practical/websites/practical.cc/public\n  ServerName practical.cc\n  ServerAlias www.practical.cc\n  ServerAlias beta.practical.cc\n  ServerAlias beta.practicalmadness.com\n  DirectoryIndex index.php index.html\n  \n  RewriteEngine On\n  RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} ^80\$\n  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^.+\\.practical\\.cc\$\n  RewriteRule (.*) http://practical.cc\$1 [R=Permanent,L]\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>\n\nUnlike most of my vhosts, this one is defined in `httpd.conf` _ahead of_ my handy wildcarded `conf/vhosts/*.conf` include, so it's _always_ the first available vhost, making it the default handler for requests not being handled by one of the other vhosts.\n\nThe really useful magic is in those rewrite rules at the end. In a nutshell, they direct any request from any domain besides `practical.cc` to my company site. This not only gracefully bounces an outdated project URL like `http://segurajobs.beta.practical.cc/` to my homepage, it also enforces my preferred domain name format for the company site &mdash; `practical.cc`, as opposed to `www.practical.cc` or `somethingelse.practical.cc`.\n\nThis kind of trick comes in really handy on SSL-secured sites like T-26. T-26's security certificate is registered to `www.t26.com`, but until recently the site was also accessible at just `t26.com`. The problem here was that since the SSL certificate specified the `www.` as part of the hostname, certain browsers would throw up a confusing error message whenever users tried to navigate to a secure area of the site. Such as the page where they pay T-26 some money. You know, the Checkout page.\n\nThe error message made customers wary of giving T-26 money because they weren't sure if their billing information would be transmitted securely. It would have been, but it's my experience that most non-power users tend to turn their brains off at the first sign of an error message. It's also my experience that browser SSL error messages are some of the worst-written, most confusing and most needlessly terrifying error messages you're likely to find, so it's not surprising that people would not _just trust me_ when I told them that the \"...identity of this website could not be verified\" error was harmless.\n\nBut I digress. Suffice to say people were not wanting to give us their money. And we like their money, so obviously something had to be done. So I used a similar rewrite trick to force all requests to use the SSL-friendly `www.t26.com` domain:\n\n<pre># SERVER_PORT &lt;&gt; Port:80\nRewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} ^80\$\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^t26\\.com\$\nRewriteRule (.*) http://www.t26.com\$1 [R=Permanent,L]\n\n# SERVER_PORT &lt;&gt; Port:443\nRewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} ^443\$\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^t26\\.com\$\nRewriteRule (.*) https://www.t26.com\$1 [R=Permanent,L]</pre>\n\nThe regexy difference here is that the T-26 rewrite looks for the _absence_ of a subdomain, whereas Practical's looks for the _presence_ of one. But the approach is the same even if the result is opposite."

And the rest of you are probably all like, \"global what on who, now?\" Well, to recap:\n\n* On August 6, I bought a bathroom scale and discovered that in my fear of studying my body and [love of fast-food breakfasts](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/07/breakfast_at_we), I had bloated to an unsexy 295 pounds (133 kg). Which, given my height and big, linebacker-esque build, while not ideal is actually not as overweight as you might think. And some of those pounds are the muscular legs of someone who rides a bike daily. Still, as some jackass once said, less is more.\n\n* On August 7, I came to the sudden realization that _one can [lose weight by working out](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/08/what_goes_on_1)_(!!!) and acquired [a gym membership](http://crunch.com/crunch/gyms/location.aspx?id=13) as well as the services of a personal trainer.\n\n* By [September 2](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/09/your_global_war_1), I had felt that burn and [pumped that area](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/09/091106.html), and had gotten myself down to just over 289 lbs. Which, for four weeks of work, was not bad.\n\nBut a couple of weeks ago, my Global War on my own body suffered a mild setback, as my trainer was offered a job that didn't involve helping sweaty nerds get back into their skinny jeans, leaving me trainerless and alone for about two weeks. During that time I fell into a deep hole, and decided the only way out of that hole was to eat more stuff. Though magically, the damage from enjoying hot dogs for lunch instead of salad on certain days was offset by the fact that my body is now used to actually using its food energy from time to time.\n\nLast Friday I started with a new trainer, we took a bunch of new measurements and metrics, and I am pleased to say the weight had stayed at an entirely reasonable 280 lbs (127 kg).\n\nI mention all of that to say this: yesterday my new trainer suggested that whenever I come in to do cardio, I should also use the adductor and abductor machines in order to strengthen my gimpy legs and gimpier knees. \"Some guys are like, 'aw, but those are girlie machines!'\" he said. \"An' I tell 'em, 'just do it.'\"\n\nCoincidentally, I am also in the process of writing/designing a couple of talk proposals for next year's [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/), and New Trainer mentioning that some men have trouble overcoming their masculine identity in order to work those thighs reminded me of this slide from one of my Keynote slideshows:\n\n![Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it - Bruce Lee](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071109/bruce_lee_quote.jpg)\n\nTo my mind, no one kicks more ass than Bruce Lee, and if he says (or rather, if we assume he's saying) not to be weighed down by orthodoxy, habit or male ego in the pursuit of the best solutions, then dammit, that's what we're gonna do.\n\nSo I have no problem using the girlie machines to fix my gimpy legs, and what's more, I have no problem using various other proverbial girlie machines in other aspects of my life and work. \n\nYou say real men use Windows or Linux? I say my Mac and its candy-ass eye candy help me do my job better.\n\nYou say my iPhone isn't a real smartphone? I say you're an idiot, then excuse myself to reply to an e-mail using my \"fake\" smartphone.\n\nYou say my double soy latt&eacute; is a girlie drink? Dude, I ordered it for the _protein_.\n\nThere's no shame in sticking to what you know, but there's no virtue in it either if it puts you in a position where you're wasting time and effort just because you <em>totally</em> ought to be able to do this one awesome thing with a fresh-baked Ruby library instead of a PHP function.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying you should <em>always</em> sprint past your comfort zone in pursuit of the best, fastest tool for the job, or else I'd have some explaining to do next time someone catches me using GarageBand to add a crossfade to an MP3 file. Just be open to the idea that if the tools you've got on you aren't working, maybe a better tool can be found somewhere outside your hidey-hole."

    description: "In which we naively expect logic from a company that requires three forms of address before they'll give me my porn."
    body: "In their many television, print and outdoor advertisements, the hard-working, brown-shirted men and women of the company ostensibly known as United Parcel Service -- better known to most of us simply as UPS -- ask the eternal question, \"What Can Brown Do For You?\"\n\nAnd today, the [noted multi-hyphenate James Duncan Davidson has offered up an answer](http://duncandavidson.com/archives/663):\n\n> Could you please, pretty please, with sugar on top, get rid of the damn checkbox that you have to click in order to track a package? Each and every time you want to track a package? _Even if you just clicked it thirty seconds before while tracking a different number?_ You know, the checkbox right under the tracking number field. This one:\n\n> ![UPS checkbox](http://duncandavidson.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ups-checkbox.png)\n\nWhat I am curious about is the certainly long, tedious process -- involving not only UPS stakeholders and various user experience \"experts,\" but also lawyers, grammarians and more lawyers -- that resulted in this massive global corporation concluding that simply telling people there were certain terms and conditions for using their package-tracking web application was not sufficient legal cover against whatever-the-fuck liability they're worried about.\n\nReally, what would be so wrong with something like this?\n\n![UPS without checkbox](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071108/ups-checkbox-fixed.png)\n\nI call it the \"Yes, Asshole, There _Was_ A Sign Posted\" theory of liability. Just because you didn't have to sign a waiver acknowledging that you can't drink beer at the public pool doesn't mean you are therefore allowed to drink beer at the public pool.\n\nIn addition to being agreeably simple, it leverages the fact that users are _already being asked to perform an action_, and simply makes agreement with these very important Terms and also-important Conditions part and parcel with the act of asking where your goddamned package is. Even if the relevant suits at UPS don't understand usability, _surely_ they could get behind an argument that involves \"leveraging\" something. But no, someone insisted on this cumbersome poka-yoke contraption.\n\nThe only possible justification I can think of is that they're storing and tracking this information to cover their own asses in the event someone figures out a way to use this tracking information for evil.\n\nOf course, they're not requiring any personally identifying information, nor do they really provide any beyond the cities of origin and destination. But it's not hard to imagine there's a massive Oracle or SQL Server database (or five) somewhere, full of all the IP addresses and package numbers ever input into this box, along with a little \"1\" to indicate that yes, this person agreed to the terms and conditions. _Just in case_ they ever need to refer back to those logs in order to demonstrate that whoever it was that asked after that porn you ordered that never arrived did, in fact, check that box.\n\nThen again, compared with the local UPS office's bizarre requirement that you bring two forms of current ID with you to pick up a package they couldn't deliver because they _totally_ thought you'd be home at 8 PM on a Friday night, this almost seems friendly of them.\n\nSo I guess we should all just be thankful we don't have to check that box in triplicate or anything.\n\n![UPS is evil](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/20071108/ups-checkbox-triplicate.png)"

    title: "Dear Hollywood Bozos"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we demand our \"30 Rock\" -- now."
    body: "**To:** Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)  \n**From:** David Nemesis  \n**Subject:** The WGA Strike\n\nDear AMPTP,\n\nI understand from several of the voices in my head who follow this sort of thing that you are having a disagreement with the two branches of the Writers' Guild of America (WGA), the union representing America's film and television-but-not-animated-or-reality-television writers. And as a consequence, the talented members of this organization have taken to standing outside your various sprawling production complexes holding up signs, instead of developing the charming, pithy stories we love so well.\n\nTo wit, here is a photograph of the lovely and talented Ms. Tina Fey, shown here picketing, and pointedly _not_ masterminding the further adventures of Liz Lemon, Jack Donaghy and that crazy Tracy Jordan for her series _30 Rock_:\n\n![Tina Fey is on strike](http://s3.amazonaws.com/lockjaw/20071105/293.fey.writers.strike.110507.jpg)\n\nNow, I know you are aware of the various points over which you and these writers of film and non-reality television are not in agreement. But just to recap them briefly:\n\n* The writers feel that rather than receiving a residual fee of four cents per unit on the sale of those popular \"DVD\" discs the kids are into nowadays, they should receive an amount greater than four cents. You believe they should be receiving an amount less than four cents, because apparently it costs money to produce these DVD discs, and you were somehow unaware of this fact when you agreed to pay the writers that amount two decades ago.\n\n* The writers also feel that they should receive a greater amount from the sale of internet downloads than for DVDs, because while DVDs cost money to produce and deliver to our fine American retailers, a download from Apple's popular iTunes Store can be piped into a consumer's home much more profitably. Of course, almost none of you have agreed to sell your wares via Apple's service, but the same principle holds true for your preferred distribution partners, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Ridiculously Locked-Down Digital Crap Shack Inc. Which leads me to the next point...\n\n* It is your position that while you have begun offering high-definition streaming videos of your television programming on various web sites, and have been profitably selling advertising to subsidize this service, these streaming videos are themselves merely \"promotional devices\" for the regular TV broadcasts of these shows. The writers feel that this is bullshit, as many viewers who don't care to pay for cable or a TiVo have begun watching the webcasts _instead of_ the broadcasts, and even if they weren't, _what the fuck, dudes?_ When you sell advertising on something like it's a real product and then insist that it's actually itself an advertisement, it seems almost like you're _trying_ to screw people over. And when one is as talented at screwing people over as you are, my Hollywood friends, it should never look like you're having to work at it.\n\n* The writers -- whose Guild's agreement with you for certain minimum compensation extends only to those professionals working on scripted television series, not reality shows or animated programs -- also feel that it's time for reality TV/animation writers to enjoy the same four-cent residual and massive patina of self-loathing that are just two of the many privileges of WGA membership. Obviously, you guys disagree, and would like to continue pretending that shit that happens on _The Hills_ is totally not staged at all.\n\nI, your humble correspondent, respect your views on these matters as you are both richer and (usually) better dressed than I am. However, this situation has resulted in an unacceptable scenario in which production has been halted on television series which I not only enjoy, but around whose new episodes I schedule my very life.\n\nIf not for the flutters of anticipation in the hours leading up to a first-run episode of _30 Rock_, how the hell am I to know that it's Thursday? Should I start keeping a sheet of paper on my wall with labels and grid lines to indicate the days of the week? Or should I perhaps start keeping an electronic device in my pocket with a button that, when pressed, tells me the date and time? Are we living in the dark ages or something?\n\nI also beg you to consider the chilling effect this may have on people like myself, who would totally be working on screenplays and spec pilots right now if only they (a) were not wary of trying to break into a profession where thinking up new and different ways to screw up _Heroes_ may not enough to put food on their family table, and (b) weren't busier still improving their _World of Warcraft_ game. My idea for a sci-fi series in which a crotchety yet brilliant forensics robot solves mysteries with the aid of a team of young replicants who do nothing but spout one-liners and have sex with each other could be the future of your industry. But now you may never see it.\n\nBut seriously though, folks -- we are hurtling with speed toward a dangerous cataclysm. And I'm not talking about a future where NBC becomes a non-stop, 24-hour _Deal or No Deal_ marathon, or the bleak prospect of never finding out why the hell some robots in deep space are hallucinating a Bob Dylan song on _Battlestar Galactica._\n\nNo, my friends: we are facing the clear and present danger of a world in which I do not get my _30 Rock_ fix. And as I, David Nemesis, am the third evilest man on the internet, you cannot comprehend the horrors that will be unleashed upon the world if this comes to pass.\n\nThese horrors may include, _but are not limited to_:\n\n* Making microscopic dings on the doors of your Bentleys, Maybachs, Lexuses, BMWs and Priuses\n\n* Opening a McDonalds franchise in the middle of Beverly Hills to depress property values\n\n* Moving to California so I can vote there, building a mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, a _seven-star_ hotel and a restaurant so exclusive only Jeffrey Katzenberg, the cast of _30 Rock_ and the ghost of Stanley Kubrick can get in, then voting in favor of a ballot proposition to raise your property taxes and give drivers licenses to illegal Mexican immigrants whose names begin with an odd-numbered letter\n\n* Taking out a full page ad in _USA Today_ explaining that John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer (\"Jim\" and \"Pam\" on the popular British retread _The Office_) are actually cousins\n\n* Going to crowded eateries at lunchtime and paying with cash instead of Debit MasterCard\n\n* Buying six or seven more video iPods from Apple, out of spite\n\n* Reading more of them things with the words printed on the paper...you know, _books_\n\nYou have, in short, been warned. I therefore demand an immediate resumption of negotiations, leading to a new contract in which the writers get a fair deal, and in which Tina Fey gets several million (more) dollars in return for agreeing never to give Jack a quirky cookie jar hobby again.\n\nI eagerly await your next move.\n\nYour friend,\n\nDavid Nemesis"

    description: "In which I once again talk about Mac OS X Leopard, and run down the features I'm looking forward to."
    body: "<span style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1.8em 1.8em\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-10-25_baby_leopard.jpg\" alt=\"Cute widdle deadly cat\"></span> The fine folks at Macworld just published [a rundown of their favorite Mac OS X Leopard features](http://www.macworld.com/2007/10/firstlooks/leodraft/index.php?pf=1), and it seems like the consensus is that Time Machine and the new iChat are the top draft picks from the 300+ new features in the new OS.\n\nOn the eve of Leopard's worldwide launch tomorrow, here's my list of the top ten features I'm looking forward to sinking my fangs into:\n\n1. **Spaces:** I've [written previously about why Spaces is awesome](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/10/300).\n\n2. **AutoFS and other networking improvements:** Yeah, this will never make it onto a t-shirt, but apart from finally having usable virtual desktops this is the one change that will solve the most day-to-day problems I have with Tiger. And if you've ever gotten a ten-minute Spinning Cursor of Doom while working with a network drive, WebDAV share or iDisk from the Finder, you'll find Leopard's new networking code is a godsend, as the system now has a multi-threaded, robust system for handling the mounting and unmounting of networked volumes. In English, that means no more Finder crashes when you try to open a shared disk on a computer that's been turned off.\n\n\tIt's not clear how deep the improvements go -- or, for example, if they've made the Finder's WebDAV access solid enough for .Mac's iDisk to be worth using -- but just the mount/unmount improvements will make using shared volumes in the Finder much, much smoother.\n\n3. **Simple screen sharing in the Finder/iChat:** You can now take over control of another Mac on your network -- or, using iChat, over the internet -- with a single click. While this feature is being positioned as a collaboration tool (where you can simply hand control of the screen off to whoever you're working with so you could, say, collaborate on a document or get hands-on help from an IT guy), it'll also be a great way for people or workgroups who are using another Mac as a server to manage those machines without leaving their chairs. I plan to use it with the old iMac G5 I'm using as a media server.\n\n4. **The new iCal:** iCal's UI has been a bit pathetic -- it's still brushed metal in Tiger, and has seen woefully few changes since the app was introduced way back in OS X Jaguar five years ago. In addition to now having the iTunes 7-like \"Dark Metal\" default appearance shared by all Leopard apps, there's now inline editing of events and kick-ass integration with Mail. More importantly, iCal supports group scheduling using CalDAV, an open-source calendar sharing platform. Apple's released a free, open-source Darwin Calendar Server, which serves as the backend for the iCal Server tool bundled with the server edition of Leopard. The main difference between the two is that Calendar Server requires some sysadmin know-how and is strictly DIY, whereas iCal Server has an easy-to-use graphical interface and is fully supported by Apple.\n\n\tI'm not keen on having to set up a CalDAV server for myself if I'm the only one using it. But imagine how cool it would be if Google were to add CalDAV access to Google Calendar?\n\n5. **Calculations in Spotlight:** I mentioned this briefly in my last big Leopard post, but you can now run simple mathematical queries directly from the Spotlight search bar. Whenever I need to do some simple arithmetic, I've been opening up an iTerm window, launching the interactive Ruby interpreter (`irb`) and using that as a ridiculously powerful pocket calculator. This is like using a bulldozer to look for a china cup, and being able to use Spotlight will be much faster.\n\n6. **Tabs and other UI improvements in the Terminal:** Speaking of iTerm, golly gee -- I guess since 2005 somebody at Apple realized some of us use the Terminal for more than the occasional bit of Unix troubleshooting. iTerm (an open-source shell interface with such lovely features as tabbed windows) is nice enough and has gotten a lot less quirky in recent releases, but it's _never_ been as fast or solid as Apple's built-in Terminal client. But I work in Rails, and my workflow involves having at least two terminals open at once (one for tailing logs, one for running commands). And Leopard's Terminal also has a streamlined UI for customizing the look and feel of my command line experience, will be pretty nice.\n\n7. **Time Machine:** I mention it just to get it out of the way. Time Machine is one of those things I hope I will never need and will seldom use, which is kind of the whole point. I'm not all that wild about the wacky full screen space-travel interface for navigating Time Machine backups, but at least it's intuitive. And the important part is that it backs my stuff up automatically in the background.\n\n8. **Secure AirPort networks now denoted with an icon:** Because seriously -- looking for an open hotspot by trying every network and seeing which ones don't prompt for a password is stupid.\n\n9. **iLife browser in the system file chooser:** Because, really -- why should I open up iPhoto or Photo Booth if all I need is to get to that one goofy photo I took of myself last week for a blog post?\n\n10. **Dashcode and Safari 3 (Final):** I'm putting these in a tie for 10th place because they've both been out in beta for a while. Which isn't to say there won't be any welcome polishes or new features I'll be glad to get into. I love the new, non-brushed metal look/feel in Safari, and it'll be good for Safari 3 to be out of beta. And Dashcode is just awesome -- not that one strictly _needs_ an IDE to make a freakin' Dashboard widget."

    title: "300"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we briefly mention some of the hundreds of new features in Mac OS X Leopard, and talk more deeply about just one."
    body: "Recently I linked to a blog post about Windows Vista, where the author was countering the Vista backlash on the basis that Microsoft's boring little baby is (in fact) not as bad as everyone says. And you know, I'm inclined to agree with that. Vista is far from a terrible product, and it's got a lot of things to recommend it, especially for less savvy users who need enhanced protection from viruses and other malware baked right in.\n\nBut from an end-user standpoint, Vista comes off as totally lacking in imagination. The biggest, most noticeable changes from XP at the user level are changes to existing functionality, which for a non-enthusiast with other things they could spend \$149 on would beg the question: what was wrong with the old way that I should pay for the same features done over again?\n\nI mention that to say this: the difference between Apple and Microsoft -- at least when it comes to marketing an OS upgrade -- is that Apple knows the value of giving us something new, even if it's silly or stupid, to create the impression that when we pay \$130 for software we mostly already have we're actually getting something out of the deal.\n\nSo today, in honor of Apple's new [Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) _finally_ having a ship date, I'd like to highlight a couple of unsung Leopard features, for the benefit of fellow Mac fans who've been hearing about the new Leopard hotness for over a year and thus probably already know about headlining acts like the new system UI or Time Machine.\n\n'Cos while it's one thing for Apple to just tell us there are \"300 new features\" in Leopard, it's quite another to [see them all listed on a really, really long web page](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html).\n\nSome of the highlights you may not already know about:\n\n* The Terminal app -- _praise jebus hallelujah_ -- has got tabs, just like iTerm. Tabs in Terminal work just like they do in Safari 3 (complete with dragging and a \"Merge All Windows\" command). And that horrific window settings panel (or panels) have been consolidated into an Inspector palette.\n\n* There are _tons_ of small security improvements, most of which could be called preventative since (unlike Windows) there have never been any truly major security exploits on Mac OS X.\n\n\t* New applications downloaded to your Mac from the Internet are \"tagged\" as such, and the first time you run such an app the system asks for your okay.\n\n\t* Apps can now be signed with a security certificate for added trustiness, with all Apple-created bundled apps (e.g. iChat, Safari, Mail) coming signed by default.\n\t\n\t* Apps can also be \"sandboxed,\" limiting their access to the system so as to prevent a security flaw in one app or service from exposing the whole shebang.\n\n\t* You can create one-off \"Guest\" user accounts that are purged automatically on log out, so visitors and other transients can use your computer without mucking around in your stuff or leaving behind a bunch of their own.\n\t\n\t* And Leopard has a \"library randomization\" feature similar to the one Microsoft introduced in Vista, which places system libraries in randomly-chosen memory addresses to prevent hackers from using their knowledge of where certain things are in memory to break into your system.\n\n* Know how you can type an equation into Google and get a calculation instead of a search? Now Spotlight does that too. (This will be a welcome replacement for my current habit of using an interactive Ruby shell as a calculator.)\n\n* Open/Save dialogs can now display an icon view, in addition to list and column views. The Open dialog now also includes an iLife browser -- systemwide. Which means that _de facto_ Photoshop-iPhoto integration is coming in just ten short days.\n\n* Automator (the utility that lets you create automated \"workflows\" without the use of scripting) now includes a \"Watch Me Do\" feature that lets you record GUI events (like clicking a button) or actions from apps without their own Automator events.\n\n* iChat now has built-in support for AOL's Mobile Forwarding service, so you can turn SMS forwarding on or off easily. iChat also now (finally) supports the \"invisible\" status option.\n\n* The AirPort menu extra (you know, the menu where you select which hotspot you're using) now denotes secure networks with a lil' padlock icon, so you can easily find open access points for all your wardriving needs.\n\n* Because all parents are kept up at night by the fear that their children will be scarred by profanity on a Wikipedia article about Teletubbies, Leopard includes a \"Wikipedia Content Filter\" that \"limit[s] access to profanity in Wikipedia.\" Sounds good, now how about the other 9,999,999,999 websites?\n\n* The system text-to-speech synthesizer is getting a new, English-accented voice named \"Alex.\" If you don't think this is cool, you just haven't watched enough sci-fi. Or heard John Cleese narrate your GPS directions in your car.\n\n* You may already know that Leopard's Mail app now has a built-in RSS reader. But not that Safari and Mail's RSS-reading functions share information, so that if you view an RSS feed in Safari it'll show up as read in Mail (and vice versa). So really, what you get is _one_ systemwide RSS feature, with your choice of user experiences -- Firefox-like, Thunderbird-like or both.\n\n\n### Trading Spaces ###\n\nAll of the things I mentioned are cool things, and I may use some or all of them. But there's another reason I told my little \"feature marketing\" parable about Vista at the top of the post, which speaks to the real heart of why Vista's percieved as a failure.\n\nIt's always a little bit cool and a little bit funny when Apple says they've packed over a hundred (or 200! Or 300!) new features into the next Mac OS X, but when you get down to brass tacks there are always just one or two features that get your ass into the stores and your credit card out of your Scooby-Doo wallet. Like when Tiger came out: as much as I could try to convince myself that I was really paying for<sup>[1](#20071016_fn1)</sup> Core Data or .Mac Syncing or some of the system-level improvements, I must admit the feature I was looking forward to playing with when I got the thing home was Dashboard.\n\nWhen FedEx brings me my Leopard DVD a week from Friday, I know that after I install it I'll be enjoying the Ruby scripting bridge, the new Finder UI and many other things for all the months and years until 10.6 comes out. But for me that One Big Feature -- the one I'm jonesing for even now -- is [Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html).\n\nYes, I know that virtual desktops have been around forever, and that Mac OS X has had two very decent implementations -- Desktop Manager and VirtueDesktops -- for a while now. But VirtueDesktops can be a little bit arcane, and it really does not play nicely with multiple displays, particularly with hot-plugging my Cinema Display into my laptop for when I'm at my desk.\n\nI played around with a pre-release build of Leopard a few weeks ago, and Spaces simply blew me away. Apple really has done a terrific job making virtual desktops easy for anyone to set up, navigate and use without sacrificing any power. The killer feature is the ability to zoom out (Expos&eacute;-style) and see all your desktops at once, and then to not only jump between them but also to move windows and apps across the different spaces by simply dragging their windows around.\n\nAnd not only can Spaces gracefully handle losing a second display (each Space simply gets its windows consolidated onto the remaining screen real estate), when that second display is plugged in each space is shown in the correct shape and proportion.\n\nFor example, when my 23-inch Cinema is hooked up to my 15-inch MacBook Pro with the lid open, instead of seeing four rectangular spaces I see four shapes matching my current screen layout. I like to use my laptop screen as a \"dashboard\" of sorts, holding my e-mail inbox, iTunes miniplayer and RSS reader while I reserve the larger main display for actual work. Spaces allows me to not just move windows off into the ether to limit clutter, but to create separate (and separately useful) distinct workspaces that are perfectly tuned to whatever task I'm on.\n\nVirtueDesktops and Desktop Manager can do this too, to an extent. But where Spaces allows me to click and drag, VirtueDesktops forces me to use an arcane set of key commands that don't always work the way I need them to.

    title: "Better Living Through Ubiquity"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we explain how Google became the shiznit."
    body: "Those hard-hitting, curious investigative journalists at the Associated Press have noted that golly gee, for a company that makes almost all its money from advertising [Google doesn't seem to spend much of that money advertising itself](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2007/10/14/1024683-google-skimps-on-its-own-advertising).\n\nThe funny thing is, the AP story can't really seem to explain _how_ Google became such an industry player despite spending almost nothing on marketing over the past few years. They do try, but the quotes and explanations they find tend to sound good while explaining nothing:\n\n> Although Google regularly promotes its brand and services on its own online ad network, that soapbox hasn't been the key to its ubiquity.\n\n> Instead, Google has relied on word-of-mouth and the media's obsessive coverage of its every move to establish a prized brand just nine years after Page and Brin first set up shop in a Silicon Valley garage.\n\nOkay, so \"word-of-mouth\" and \"media obsession\" -- two things which, in consumer marketing terms, are virtually the same thing as \"magic pixie dust.\" Even word-of-mouth or (if you must) \"viral\" campaigns can be cultivated by a savvy marketer, and noting that a product or service is simply _promoted_ via word-of-mouth isn't news.\n\nWhat the AP is trying to sound intelligent about here is how Google can become not just successful but _ubiquitous_ with few or no media buys. And ironically they come closest to explaining it by citing an example of another company that's managed to become ingrained in the American consumer landscape while spending almost nothing on traditional mass advertising:\n\n> Starbucks Corp. spent just \$95 million on advertising last year, 49 percent less than Google did. Like Google, Starbucks made a name for itself by developing a distinctive product that quickly resonated with consumers whose enthusiasm became infectious.\n\nReporter Michael Liedtke wants to attribute Starbucks's market dominance to some more of that \"infectious enthusiasm\" pixie dust, but I think the answer -- both for them and for Google -- is way simpler than that.\n\nIt's a strategy you might call \"designed ubiquity,\" where you force your target market to engage with your product by going to where your target market lives. For Starbucks, that means opening more than 13,000 retail stores in locations with a lot of visibility for a large number of well-heeled consumers. On many a Chicago street corner, it's easier to notice an actual Starbucks than it would be to notice an ad for a Starbucks.\n\nAnd the placement of Starbucks locations corresponds to both the \"Third Place\" marketing philosophy and the migratory pattern of the ideal Starbucks customer. If you're a well-heeled white person living in an affluent North Side neighborhood, you're likely to pass at least one Starbucks on the way to and from work, and if you work in the Loop you'll spend your day literally surrounded by them.\n\nStarbucks locations aren't _really_ ubiquitous, though -- they just _seem_ that way in certain major cities. Most Chicago neighborhoods have no Starbucks stores at all, and most have just one or two locations. But they're on every corner of the parts of the city where their most desired market (yuppies) lives and works, that's enough to forcibly insert their brand into our national psyche, and the rest, indeed, is just word of mouth.\n\nHow does this relate to Google? Well, let me ask you something, Readers -- how often do you go to `google.com` these days? I know we all end up there, and I'll allow that many of you start there. But do you really type that URL (or click a bookmark of it) into your browser when you want to search for something?\n\nOr do you just type your search query into a handy little box in the corner of your browser window?\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-10-14_safari-google.png\"></p>\n\nCurrently and since at least 2003, Google has been the default search engine in both Firefox and Safari. (I won't even mention the Google Toolbar for IE and Firefox, which has been around even longer.)\n\nAs with Starbucks's targeted ubiquity, being the default search provider for those browsers puts the Google search product at the fingertips of only the roughly 20% of the market who use them. But that's a valuable 20%. Firefox users are more likely to be savvy, experienced users who other people turn to for advice or recommendations. And until this year, Safari was a Mac-only product that had the benefit of being the only factory-installed browser on any new Apple computer, and Mac users likewise tend to be folks other people listen to when it comes to technology.\n\nMy point here is that these placements didn't simply come out of the clear blue sky. Google made deals with Mozilla and Apple to become their default search provider, allowing them to place themselves directly onto their most valuable target market's browser windows, inserting themselves effectively into the zeitgeist without the expense and uncertainty of a big media buy.\n\nThe AP may be right that traditional advertising is becoming less and less relevant to the success of a company or product. But the alternative isn't magic pixie dust. It's a very simple and very humane: Google and Starbucks created compelling products, then found ways to challenge people to interact with their product in a way that -- oh my god -- was useful in its own right. For Starbucks, it was the convenience of being able to walk to the corner for a latt&eacute; in less time than it took to hit the break room at your office. For Google, it was removing the added step of visiting their site to initiate a search.\n\nAdvertising is begging users who may have no desire or need for your product to come to you and ask for it. The secret to these companies' success was to identify the customers they needed to reach and then to go after them aggressively while still finding a way to bring some value to the party.\n\nMaybe that's why Google's marketing model is so hard for other companies and the media to figure out -- they're way too busy to beg."

    title: "The Economics of Gold-Digging"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we compare your product to a girl who wants to marry for money."
    body: "Steven Levitt [posts to the _Freakonomics_ blog](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/the-economics-of-gold-digging/), relaying a (possibly apocryphal) Craigslist exchange between a \"beautiful (spectacularly beautiful) 25-year-old girl\" in NYC very open about looking to marry a guy making at least \$500K/year, and a respondent who followed her lead and pointed out some of the flaws in her plan.\n\nFrom the girl's post, the passage that sticks out for me is this one:\n\n>  I dated a businessman who makes average around 200 - 250K. But that&rsquo;s where I seem to hit a roadblock. 250,000K won&rsquo;t get me to Central Park West. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married to an investment banker and lives in Tribeca, and she&rsquo;s not as pretty as I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right? How do I get to her level?\n\nThis just reminds me so much of the folks who think they could just be the next internet mogul if only they can somehow get 4 million users for their stupid social dating startup, or bad filmmakers who think the only reason they're not bigger than Spielberg is because of some massive conspiracy of Jews.\n\nAs for what this woman in her yoga class is doing that makes her more of a catch than our dear heroine, the question I _really_ want to ask is what they both do with their lives besides marrying rich men (or try to) and doing yoga. For most men (shallow beasts that we are) tend to marry women we could see living with for kind of a long while. That often means they've got something more going on than surface beauty.\n\nIf you're looking for how this relates back to something nerdy, here it is: in the marketplace of love, this girl is competing on her looks alone. Now, let's imagine for a moment that what this girl is selling isn't her spectacularly beautiful body, but rather a spectacularly beautiful product -- say, a hot new music player that, if looks were everything, should be an \"iPod killer.\"\n\nThe trouble is, looks (while certainly relevant) are not the only thing, nor even the most important thing. The reason why the iPod bests the Zune, or why the Wii is kicking the asses of both the Xbox 360 and PS3, is because those products provide a better overall experience than the competition. They've all got beauty and charm, but the winners are the products that have beauty, charm _and_ brains. They're the girls who'll keep you up until 4 AM talking about French films, or sharing stupid jokes about whatever nonsense.\n\nUltimately, it's the difference between saying you're better and _being_ better. 'Cause if this girl really were prettier, wittier and classier than some schlub in her yoga class, she wouldn't have to think about how to attract her sugar daddy. The moral of the story here is: in marketing as in dating, you'll always do better if you can actually bring something to the relationship besides a snotty attitude about your looks."

    title: "A Truly Special Edition"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which the \"discbox\" version of Radiohead's \"In Rainbows\" makes me think about what it is we're buying when we buy music."
    body: "It seems to me that with their amazingly daring approach to selling and marketing their upcoming album _In Rainbows_, Radiohead are not only challenging the traditional, label-dominated music industry business model but also forcing us all to think about what it is we're buying when we buy music.\n\nA lot of attention is being focused, of course, on their decision to release the digital version of _In Rainbows_ on a \"pay what you want\" basis, which I think Pitchfork is spot on in describing as [\"basically the band leaking the album and asking you for a donation to access it.\"](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/46028-radiohead-album-coming-out-as-regular-cd-too) \n\nBut I'm way more intrigued by the decision to make the first (and so far only) physical release, the &pound;40 (\$82) \"discbox\" due to ship in December, a deluxe product aimed at fans, collectors and serious audiophiles. \n\nIt's fair to assume, I think, that casual listeners -- the ones who'd buy a CD release only to rip it onto their iPods or listen to it on a Discman or car stereo, not a bitchin' home stereo -- will be entirely satisfied the digital release. For one thing it's (more or less) free, and while casual listeners aren't really the brazen pirates the major labels think they are, they're definitely price-conscious. And while an audiophile might complain about the difference in quality between an MP3 and a well-mastered CD, a casual listener would neither notice nor care.\n\nIn this post-Napster, post-iPod era, there really are only three reasons why one would buy a CD rather than a download:\n\n* The listener doesn't have a computer or broadband internet access, or a friend who would rip them a copy of something. I.e., they buy the CD because it's truly their only option.\n\n* They _can_ get it online, but prefer the superior audio quality of the CD release, and/or want their music without DRM. That being said, in either of these first two cases the packaging is less important than the music.\n\n* They _can_ get it online, and may rip a copy for use on an iPod or some such, but more than that they want the physical object to add to their collection.\n\nIt's important to bear in mind that this initial self-release of the album is really just a first step, aimed at would-be pirates and \"early adopters\" who want the music more quickly than the creaky wheels of retail distribution will allow. Radiohead have confirmed that they're talking to a number of labels (including their former label, the EMI-owned Capitol/Parlophone) about a retail release of _In Rainbows_ to come out next year.\n\nFor that first group of consumers who buy CDs because that's their only option, _In Rainbows_ isn't going to be available until it's out on CD. And the second group, who want the higher quality or openness of a CD but don't actually care about the physical packaging, will be more or less taken care of by the MP3 release.\n\nThat leaves the third group: people who buy CDs or vinyl LPs because they genuinely want a tactile, physical object, not just a distribution platter for the content. The discbox version of _In Rainbows_ is absolutely aimed at this group.\n\nThe discbox, as shown in photographs and described on the band's site, is more like an art object than a music release. It's not just that it's an expanded edition of the album, or that it includes both CD and vinyl versions of it. It's the fact that each box is made to order, with none of the usual compromises that are made in trying to fit a band's work into an easily shippable retail package. It's an absolutely uncompromising version of the work, for people who would buy such a beautiful, special, semi-unique object.\n\nFor a band that's so critical of globalization and homogenized corporate culture, the _In Rainbows_ discbox is like the ultimate repudiation of the way music has been distributed and sold for the last few decades. A discbox may not be handmade, _per se_, but neither is it mass-produced. The point of it isn't to deliver the content to a particular consumer format, but to showcase that content in the best way(s) possible, creating a wonderful, personal connection between the band and the listeners engaged (and yes, rich) enough to pay eighty bucks for something more special than just another CD.\n\nIn a way, the \"free\" digital release of the album is Radiohead's concession to mass culture: if the object of a music release is simply dissemination, then why not remove _all_ the barriers and put the thing out there in a way that people can get it, conveniently and _right dammit now_? They're still a working band, of course, and they're still asking for money in return for their work (while allowing for the likelihood that a number of people will still take the music without paying for it).\n\nI doubt that the band is under any illusion about the discbox -- it's definitely a premium product, and it's designed and priced accordingly. But I think it's great that their idea of a \"deluxe\" edition is more than just a second disc or a slightly fancier CD case, but an object people can _really_ enjoy owning."

    title: "The Weird Turn Pro"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "A neocon writer advocates nuking Iraq, then making Bush an American dictator. There is simply no nonsense more quality than this."
    body: "There are some (well, many, if not most) of us on the political left (and the center-left, and the center, and the center-right, and maybe also the right) who quietly (or vocally) are wishing we could hold some kind of magical referendum (or pitchfork-mob protest) and remove President George W. Bush from power, like today. There simply aren't that many informed, engaged people left who unequivically support the President and his policies, and a majority of Americans think we'll be better off when he's out of office.\n\nBut lest we slip into a coma of na&iuml;ve reverie, a comforting delusion that absolutely no one still likes the guy, we should remember that the same crazy people who pushed for the crazed Bush foreign policy still walk among us, and many of them have not stopped being crazy.\n\nTo wit, we have [a new essay by neoconservative writer Philip Atkinson](http://www.samefacts.com/archives/watching_conservatives_/2007/08/neocon_dreams_bush_as_president_for_life.php) that is _so_ whacked, the far-right Center for Security Policy (who originally published it) have totally disavowed it.\n\nSome choice snippets:\n\n> The wisest course would have been for President Bush to use his nuclear weapons to slaughter Iraqis until they complied with his demands, or until they were all dead. Then there would be little risk or expense and no American army would be left exposed. But if he did this, his cowardly electorate would have instantly ended his term of office, if not his freedom or his life. The simple truth that modern weapons now mean a nation must practice genocide or commit suicide.\n\n> ...\n\n> If President Bush copied Julius Caesar by ordering his army to empty Iraq of Arabs and repopulate the country with Americans, he would achieve immediate results: popularity with his military; enrichment of America by converting an Arabian Iraq into an American Iraq (therefore turning it from a liability to an asset); and boost American prestiege while terrifying American enemies.\n\n> He could then follow Caesar's example and use his newfound popularity with the military to wield military power to become the first permanent president of America, and end the civil chaos caused by the continually squabbling Congress and the out-of-control Supreme Court.\n\n> President Bush can fail in his duty to himself, his country, and his God, by becoming ex-president Bush or he can become President-for-Life Bush: the conqueror of Iraq, who brings sense to the Congress and sanity to the Supreme Court. Then who would be able to stop Bush from emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world? For only an America united under one ruler has the power to save humanity from the threat of a new Dark Age wrought by terrorists armed with nuclear weapons.\n\nThis is one of those things where you don't know whether to laugh because the ideas espoused in the essay are so crazy, or cry because someone actually, seriously believes them. I don't mean to imply that I think any non-liberal viewpoint is insane. I think pro-lifers are misguided and maybe a little cruel, but their beliefs at least follow some semblance of logic. Likewise I would say that to believe in intelligent design is solipsistic at best and bloody ignorant at worst, but it's not _insane_.\n\nEven the hawks and Bush supporters who believe [failure to win in Iraq will result in a military conquest of the American heartland by the Islamo-fascists](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/023430.php) are simply trying their best to make sense of the intentionally confusing and manipulative information that our government has put out to bamboozle the American people into supporting an idiotic war in Iraq. After all, conquest is historically the objective in warfare; a nation goes to war not just to bomb your shit and leave, but to rape your women, steal your bibles and sit in your Barcaloungers. And the Arab terrorists are at war with us, they must have the same objective as the Nazis or the Soviets, right?\n\nAtkinson's essay is not simply misguided or putting forth an unpopular viewpoint. He's repudiating the most basic American values (not to mention a sixth-grader's understanding of world history and geopolitics) to find the shortest, easiest path to a solution only Adolf Hitler could love.\n\nEven the neocons think this guy is nuts, so I won't waste any more words arguing with a lunatic. However, I do want to point out a couple of things I learned in 7th grade social studies:\n\n* While Caesar did slaughter his share of the Gauls, he didn't kill so many of them as to be at all comparable with the devastation to be caused if America were to use its nuclear arsenal on Iraq.\n\n\tAnd not only did Caesar not kill all the Gauls, Mr. Atkinson may be surprised to learn their descendants are still bopping around. They're called the French.\n\n* The crushing of \"all political opposition\" didn't exactly end the personal threat to Caesar. In fact, he was murdered by a passel of Senators including some of his closest friends and supposed allies, precisely because he was a tyrant. I know this because a little-known English playwright named William Shakespeare wrote a little play about it. It's also been mentioned in a couple of obscure movies and TV shows.\n\n* Caesar didn't have \"newfound\" popularity with the military, nor was he a civilian ruler like the U.S. president. He was a leading general who already had the support of his own army. And when he seized absolute power, he was opposed by other generals and their armies, not to mention the Roman equivalents to the \"continually squabbling Congress and out-of-control Supreme Court.\" (See above notes about the Senate literally _fucking killing him_.)\n\n* I shouldn't have to point this out to anyone, and certainly not to anyone who's seen a _Terminator_ movie, but _you can't nuke a country and then immediately repopulate it._ This is one reason why nuclear weapons are evil -- they not only kill the living, they ruin the landscape for years afterward. This isn't a moral issue, it's simple physics.\n\n\tAt the time of this writing, George W. Bush has about 15 months left in office. It takes more than 15 months for an irradiated nuclear wasteland to become usable _liebensra&uuml;m_ for American oil derricks, freeways, subdivisions and strip malls. So Atkinson's modest proposal is not only abhorrent, it's also more than a little impractical.\n\n* Back to the Caesar thing, as I've mentioned once or twice, Caesar was not welcomed as Rome's first fascist ruler with candy and a stripper. In fact, he was killed. Therefore, there is no historical precedent for someone seizing absolute power and then \"emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world\".\n\n\tGranted, Caesar Augustus -- Julius Caesar's adopted son and the first actual Roman emperor -- was an absolute ruler, and generally the people who become absolute rulers of the world are first absolute rulers of their own nations. But that's not what Atkinson is saying. He's saying Bush should emulate Julius Caesar, _then_ emulate Augustus, while sidestepping the part about 37 stab wounds in the back."

    title: "Drunkenbatman Doesn't Care About Black People"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Maybe if you asked some better questions, you wouldn't come off sounding like a nerdy Klansman."
    body: "Oh my stars and garters, this is upsetting: Mac nerd blogger \"Drunkenbatman\" moderated a developer panel at \"Wolf\" Rentzsch's C4[1] conference this past weekend, and he apparently thought it would be a good idea to ask his panelists to respond to the following incredibly stupid thesis: [black people don't use Macs.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rtmfd/1097058025/)\n\nAnd lest anyone think he was trying to gently get into a serious discussion about the matter, he's quoted (by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2007/08/c4_1_in_a_nut)) as also saying \"the only black people at Macworld are outside begging for change.\"\n\nFirst let me be clear: I wasn't there, and I'm getting this information third-hand through the blogs just like most of you. However, the most important fact -- that Drunkenbatman used valuable panel time at a very lovely conference to ask some very talented developers why they think blacks don't use their products -- is not under dispute. And with statements like the aforementioned, it seems clear to me that at best he was trying to stir up some needless controversy in a gross, ham-fisted way that stifled discussion more than stimulated it.\n\nThe thing is, generally Drunkenbatman is probably right -- it would not surprise me to find Mac ownership is statistically lower among black households than white ones. But that's far from the whole story, and while D.B. may be in the same time zone as truth, he didn't provide any numbers to demonstrate his point as anything but his own impression.\n\nIf we really wanted to understand this issue rather than just start using a bunch of impressions, conjectures and hearsay as the basis for talking about why an entire huge subset of the population don't use the same computers as we do, we might start by asking a few simple questions:\n\n\n### Do black people use PCs? ###\n\nI'm talking everything from eMachines to Dells to Macs to those free PeoplePC boxes. Those of us in the techno-elite tend to assume that literally everyone has a computer these days, and it's simply not true. Many people, especially in economically depressed areas, don't have computers in their home. If they use PCs, it's at a school or library, and these days those institutions are more apt to purchase Windows boxes.\n\nI don't mean to say -- and I'll be offering this disclaimer a lot -- that all black people are poor. But many of them are, in greater numbers and to a greater extent than white people. And computers, while an extremely fun and useful tool, are definitely a first-world concern if you're having trouble buying bread.\n\nAnd if (relative) poverty is a factor, then if blacks are less apt to use Macs then there may be a reason beyond anything at a software conference is in a position to discuss: price. Just last week at the Mac media event, Steve Jobs pointed out that Apple chooses not to compete in the super-low end of the market. That's all well and good for those of us who have more money to spend on computers, but if money is tight and you need a computer, even I would have trouble telling someone not to go for a \$400 PC bundle from Wal-Mart. I absolutely believe Macs are worth the extra money, but that matters less if there is no extra money to spend.\n\nDrunkenbatman posed the question as if it were a given that it's just a matter of choice (or else why talk about it at C4[1]?), and clearly it ain't necessarily so.\n\n\n### Where are black people buying PCs? ###\n\nEver noticed that almost every Apple retail store is in a well-heeled, mostly white shopping district? And that many upper middle class _white_ communities don't even have them yet?\n\nAnd has anyone perhaps noticed that there's a strong correlation between Apple's significantly improved retail presence this decade and their significantly improved market share?\n\nThe lack of Apple Stores in predominantly black areas of course wouldn't stop someone from driving over to their closest location to check out and purchase a computer. But it's definitely the case that affluent whites in urban areas have easier access to Mac products than anyone else, and a lot of people make purchasing decisions by visiting a store and test-driving the product even if they plan to make the final purchase online. And if black consumers are anything like me, they aren't going to want to drop \$1,000 or more on an item they've never seen or touched in real life.\n\nOf course, the lack of retail presence hasn't seemed to hurt Dell very much, but that's because unlike the Mac their product is similar enough to a Gateway or HP machine on sale at Best Buy that people feel like they can make an informed decision without having to touch the physical item. Basically, if it runs Windows and comes with Office and is \$100 cheaper, it's got the edge.\n\nThe Mac, on the other hand, has started climbing its way out of the nerd ghetto due to Apple's aggressive push to get their computers out into world so people can see for themselves why they're great. And even I admit that some Apple designs, like the new keyboards, can be alienating until you use them and can understand the logic behind them.\n\nMy point here is that even if blacks are no less likely to buy Windows PCs, and are equally able to buy Macs, it's not yet clear to what extent they would prefer Windows just because they're what's for sale in their neighborhoods. And just to be clear, I'm not basing this on the assumption that all black neighborhoods are cracked out ghettos. I'm saying that Macs still have a relatively light retail presence even in predominantly white neighborhoods. And this too might be a factor.\n\n\n### Is this just about the conferences? ###\n\nDid Drunkenbatman really mean to say that black people don't use Macs? Or did he mean that black people don't go to conferences or become rockstar indie Mac developers? Because by that metric, we're also really way low on women in the Mac community too, even though no one in their right mind would say women don't use Macs.\n\nIn a way, this makes this whole thing even worse. If Drunkenbatman had wanted to get into a broader discussion of why black users are less likely to be Mac users, that's fine. But I don't think that's where he was coming from. I think the question he _meant_ to ask of the panel and audience at C4[1] was: _why aren't more of you black?_ On that basis, it's not clear which is worse: being passive-aggressively racist, or also passive-aggressively accusing everyone else of being racist.\n\nRacism is not just burning a cross or wearing a white sheet. The more insidious racism is the belief that one can make broad generalizations about an entire people and _not_ be racist, because you're obviously objectively right and therefore cannot possibly be racist.\n\nMaybe if Drunkenbatman asked some better questions, he wouldn't come off sounding so much like a nerdy Klansman."

    title: "Daily Agenda for Sunday, August 12"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "My minutiae is more awesome than your minutiae."
    body: "* **3:30-4:00 AM:** Wake up grudgingly, due to (a) bedroom being too warm, (b) bedroom being too cold, (c) bedroom being too dark, (d) bedroom being too bright, (e) me needing to pee really badly, (f) a nightmare about dead orphans or (g) some combination of the above, before fixing whatever's wrong (except for the dead orphan nightmare, which being a nightmare tends to resolve itself) and going back to sleep.\n\n* **7:30 AM:** Woke up grudgingly. Scrounged around for water. Noticed my Camelbak at the foot of the bed. Drank water. Cursed the heavens for poor quality of Chicago tap water. Made mental note to buy, like, a _fucking case_ of SmartWater. Fell asleep again. Forgot mental note.\n\n* **8:00 AM:** Woke up for real this time. Got dressed and ride down the street to McDonalds to acquire breakfast, which often as not consists of a steak/egg/cheese bagel, hash browns and a 20-oz iced coffee. Returned home to look at movie showtimes.\n\n* **9:30-10:00 AM:** Rode out to see the earliest possible showing of a movie, so as to avoid crowds, traffic and higher evening ticket prices. This week's matin&eacute;e: _The Bourne Ultimatum_ (or as it's called in the original French, _Boring Pug-Faced Amnesiac Spy On The Run 3: Electric Boogaloo_). Other recent Sunday morning movies have included _Harry Potter 5: Yes, We Swear They're 15_ and that one movie with a happy, shiny title that starts out as a compelling sci-fi drama about fixing the Sun, but turns into a slasher movie in space. You know, _Sunshine_.\n\n* **11:45 AM:** Have reached two conclusions: these _Bourne_ movies -- and indeed, cinema itself -- were better before they killed off Franka Potente's character. Seriously, in the world is there any cooler, hotter woman with a double chin? I think not, Readers. Also: Matt Damon maiming someone with a ballpoint pen was way cooler than him killing that one guy with a book.\n\n* **12:30 PM:** Have reached third conclusion: David Strathairn is like a nuclear weapon of sleazy entrenched power, to be employed only in situations when Chris Cooper and Brian Cox have tried and failed to destroy Bourne with their sleaziness. If there's a fourth _Bourne_ movie, they'll have nowhere to turn for a villain but James Cromwell, who not only bested Strathairn in sleaziness in _L.A. Confidential_ but also nearly defeated _Jack Bauer himself_ with the ultimate weapon: a logic bomb that saddled _24_ with a moronic evil family-vs-good son plot that not even _that_ show could elevate above stupid clich&eacute;.\n\n* **12:54 PM:** All kidding aside, I like how _The Bourne Ultimatum_ isn't a totally new adventure set \"three years later,\" but rather picks up _right_ where the previous movie left off. And the reason why this is good (and why _24_ is very, very bad) is because it neatly sidesteps the issue of how Bourne could just walk away from _Bourne Supremacy_'s climactic tunnel chase and survive for three years without the CIA managing to find or kill him. There is a jump forward and an entirely new story (which is tied into, but not directly continued from, the last movie), but by starting us out mere moments after the last movie, by the time we're starting to ask any boring logical questions (like: if various authorities know Marie is dead, why has no one tracked down her brother, either to tell him or as part of the hunt for Bourne?) we're back in the thick of it.\n\n* **12:57 PM:** But they totally lost me by having Moby re-record \"Extreme Ways\" for the end credits. Not only is the new version overproduced and lame _even by Moby standards(!!!!)_, having that song serve as the _de facto_ theme music for this series was like a nice time capsule of the early 2000s, a reminder that past mistakes (like voting in a government who think waterboarding is an acceptable interrogation procedure, or tying the musical vernacular of an action film series to whatever was hip in the summer of 2002) can sometimes haunt you forever.\n\n* **1:00 PM:** Visit Apple Store to check out [these new keyboards](http://www.apple.com/keyboard/) [everybody's talking about.](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/565-how-apples-small-things-influence-their-big-things) Like every great Apple design, from the \"luxo arm\" iMac G4 to the iPhone, the new keyboards -- RAZR-thin, made of aluminum and laid out like those weirdo Fisher-Price keys on the MacBooks -- are, at first glance, a little bit alienating. I mean, my _dinner plates_ are thicker than these keyboards.\n\n\tHowever, I am now convinced that this is the awesomest keyboard design I have ever seen, and will be buying one of the wireless models as soon as they're out. I'm usually not a fan of laptop keyboards, but the low-slung profile paired with a wide gap between keys make this design extremely easy to type with.\n\n\tAnd the wireless version, with its teeny laptop-like size and layout, is a good compromise between [my current keyboard](http://pfuca-store.stores.yahoo.net/haphackeylit1.html), which feels great but has no dedicated function keys, and a full-size one that would just crowd my desk.\n\n* **1:35 PM:** Success is: spending \$135 on sweat pants. I've been wearing (and wearing out) the same two pairs of Nike Dri-Fit athletic shorts since the last time I was regularly going to a gym back in 2003. They're still trucking right along, and I enjoy wearing them even as my doubts about whether they were stitched by child laborers or Chinese political prisoners eat at my soul.\n\n\tSo I once again set aside my better moral judgement and went into Niketown to buy two pairs of Dri-Fit sweat pants, to augment my workout arsenal. If these last as long as their shorter siblings have, I'll still be wearing them when I'm, like, 40. Hell, I could be _buried_ in these \$55 pairs of sweat pants.\n\n\t(Note to family of future self: please do not bury me in sweat pants.)\n\n* **2:20 PM:** There was a time -- and it was April of this year -- when I simply could not imagine riding a bicycle all the way from the Apple Store on Michigan to the Target store I go to at Logan & Elston (roughly a five mile one-way trip). There was even a time (probably in late May or early June) when I'd have remarked on that somewhere nearer the halfway point of the ride, around Lincoln & Webster.\n\n\tToday after my keyboard-fondling and sweat pants run, I rode up to Target for some moisture-wicking \"tech\" t-shirts (which, not being pants, I'm more willing to cheap out on) and remarked on my own awesome bike-riding prowess as I was getting off the bike at Target.\n\n\tAll that is to say: I've gone from my first ride back in April, where I was so winded my ears were ringing(!) after just half a mile, to today when I was able to ride five miles in 90-degree heat and barely even felt it. Your humble narrator, is, in a word, a golden god.\n\n* **3:10 PM:** I discovered a new favorite packaged sandwich: a turkey BLT from The Goddess and Grocer. Yesterday around this time I was just finishing a 12-mile circuit up and down the Lakefront Trail and stopped near the Theatre on the Lake to cool down and eat a packaged ham and cheese sandwich I grabbed at Whole Foods on my way to the lakefront. And the Lincoln Park branch of Whole Foods once again betrayed me, selling me the absolute worst \$7 sandwich I've ever tried and failed to eat in my life. (And I've eaten more than a couple Starbucks sandwiches, so this is really saying something.)\n\n\tWhere that sandwich was foul and wilted, this was fresh, with crisp vegetables and just the right amount of savory, bacony goodness. Granted, I kept the Whole Foods sandwich in my bike basket for the entire 12-mile ride (about an hour in the sun), but I really don't think it could have gone so far downhill in so short a time if it weren't well on its way to sucking when I grabbed it from the case at the market.\n\n\tThis experience combined with the ongoing nastiness of the Hot Bar at that location has left me no choice but to declare them an enemy combatant in the Global War on David, and to impose a trade embargo restricting all commerce between the Practical Nation and the prepared foods department of the Lincoln Park Whole Foods. Whole Foods, consider yourselves \"on notice.\"\n\n* **3:47 PM:** While recapping the day for _Practicalmadness_ -- which is both a creative way to squeeze a _Bourne Ultimatum_ review, a note about the new Mac keyboards and some bitching about a bad sandwich into the same single post -- realize that yesterday was 2nd anniversary of mother's death. How 'bout that.\n\n* **4:30 PM:** Scrounged around for water. Noticed my Camelbak at the foot of the bed. Drank water. Cursed the heavens for poor quality of Chicago tap water. Made mental note to buy, like, a _fucking case_ of SmartWater.\n\n* **4:31 PM:** Distracted by something shiny. Forgot mental note."

    title: "What Goes On"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Random thoughts on this idle Tuesday."
    body: "I can no longer sit back and allow David infiltration, David indoctrination, David subversion and the international David conspiracy to <del>sap and impurify all our precious bodily fluids</del> continue eating ice cream without going to the gym.\n\nSo today I announce the commencement of a **Global War on David**, an expansive program of posturing, subterfuge, chicanery and (if necessary) aggressive action to reduce my \"David footprint\" by, say, 60-90 pounds in the next however-long.\n\nThe first stage of this program, the so-called [Salad Initiative](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/06/the_salad_initiative), has been a mixed success: I am eating and enjoying more salads, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals and pure, clear water. However, I am also enjoying [hot dogs topped with foie gras](http://www.hotdougs.com/), Stephen Colbert-branded ice cream and [calorie-riffic fast food breakfasts](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/07/breakfast_at_we).\n\nThe next step in the Global War on David (GWOD) is a two-part plan to narrow what our policy experts are referring to as the \"skinniness gap\" between ourselves and the David aggressors.\n\nStep one is an escalation of the Salad Initiative: our <del>defense contractors</del> supermarket shoppers have acquired a small store of <del>weapons-grade plutonium</del> single-serving pouches of bite-size raw carrots, and some recent bad experiences with Caesar dressing have forced me to direct our scientists to begin developing \"Balsamic vinegar spritzer\" technology. This would be a spritzer bottle filled, yes, with balsamic vinegar. Yes, citizens -- we have _weaponized condiments._\n\nThe second phase involves a strategic alliance with a local health club (or gym, if you prefer) both to work out various aggressions and to begin converting some of our strategic fat reserves into usable whoop-ass energy to be canned for later use.\n\nWe are considering two such partners:\n\n* The massive, colorful, IKEA-furnished [**Crunch Gym**](http://www.crunch.com/) location over on Sheffield is massive, colorful, well equipped and only(!) a mile and a half from my house. They come [highly recommended on Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/f-3uq_tnSiMM0BvzlWx2wA), though I suspect these positive reviews are from people who also liked _Legally Blonde_. While their facilities are indeed very large and come complete with -- I kid you not -- a giant twirly three-story _fun slide_, Crunch (which shares a parent company with their much less hip and more evil competitor, Bally's Total Fitness) has appeared in [Consumerist](http://www.consumerist.com/)'s \"Most Onerous Long-Term Agreements\" section more times than I'd like.\n\n* The [**Cheetah Gym**](http://cheetahgym.com/) down the street, on the other hand, got [mixed reviews](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bGzUoeNLYBuvuQB6wE1emg), with some people citing snotty service, a cramped space and a \$1 towel fee as reasons to stay away.\n\n\tSo I might bump my elbow into four other people while using their one and only rowing machine. On the other hand, they're four blocks from my house.\n\n\tI might forget to bring a dollar and have to walk home all sweaty and nasty. On the other hand, they're four blocks from my house.\n\n\tI might feel _judged_ as I walk into the door, and their lack of real membership cards (they put a sticker on your driver's license) might remind me of being back in art school. On the other hand, _they're four blocks from my house_, in a city prone to being _absolutely fucking frozen_ two months of the year.\n\nSo like most other things, the gym decision will come down to price, amenities and my general mood. As someone who puts a premium on customer service and surface swankiness, Crunch would seem to have the edge with me.\n\nLongtime readers with savant-like memories may recall that I've [tried this whole gym thing before](http://practicalmadness.com/2003/08/baby_lets_rock), and obviously it didn't take. But there are a few differences that might help tip the scales (or eventually not, if we're following the pun) in my favor this time. I joined a gym in Alabama four years ago because my mother was pressuring me to lose weight so I could attract a girlfriend she didn't hate. (In so many words.) Now I'm joining a gym so I can beat stuff up when I'm frustrated (professionally, creatively or sexually) now that I no longer take frustration for granted, and also so I can lose weight so I can look better in those Threadless t-shirts I like so well.\n\nTo recap:\n\n* **Four years ago:** Unfortunate meddling by a parent who was unable to accept your awesome narrator for the nefarious genius that he is, combined with the sweltering Alabama hot, combined with the fact that gyms in Birmingham tend to be glorified basements that play nothing on the TVs but Fox News, and nothing on the sound system but \"Eye of the Tiger\" on loop. And at that time iPods were still \$400, and not having \$400 I had to either learn to love Survivor or start hating liberals.\n\n* **Today:** Boredom, aggression, vanity, four months' worth of _New Yorkers_ to catch up on and an iPod/iPhone strapped to my arm. Take _that_, body fat.\n\n### Hello, my name is David and I'm addicted to Apple products ###\n\nThe other big thing going on today is [an Apple event](http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/08/07/live.apple.event.coverage/), which that company has flat-out _said_ would not focus on either iPhones or iPods (leaving Macs and Apple TVs...so in other words, the Mac). This has not stopped certain morons from speculating that today's product announcements might include a new, lower-cost iPhone or a new touchscreen iPod.\n\nBoth of which, by the way, I'm convinced are coming _at some point_. Just not today.\n\nSo let's talk to _Practicalmadness_'s Mac rumors correspondent -- the Magic 8 Ball, filling in for the Ouija Board -- to find out what's coming down the pipeline in a few short hours:\n\n* **New iMacs: Most likely.** I'd be more surprised if Apple _didn't_ announce new iMacs today. (Of course, I said that about them announcing iLife/iWork '07 eight months ago and was totally wrong.) They'll be faster, cheaper and (maybe) will look different from their predecessors. I do rather doubt that they'll have an aluminum enclosure, though, since Apple markets the iMac to families with kids and to schools, where the white polycarbonate casing tends to be a feature, not a bug.\n\n* **New Mac minis: Outlook good.** No, I don't think Apple is going to kill the Mac mini. It fills a small, unglamorous but important niche in the Mac product line, serving as a simple commodity PC/server for folks who (say) already have a display they like, or who just need something bare-bones for e-mail. It's also the spiritual successor to the Power Mac Cube, which Steve Jobs pushed aggressively until it became obvious that the product was an underpowered failure. The Mini, while not a world-beater, is certainly not a failure on that scale, and I think if anything Jobs would be pushing for smaller, more powerful Minis rather than killing them off entirely.\n\n\tIn short, I just don't see them killing it. But the current Mac mini models are still rocking last year's Core Duo processors and 802.11g Wi-Fi, so if they're not gonna kill it they're going to need to roll out a Core 2 Duo version with up-to-date wireless and stuff if it's going to stay relevant.\n\n\tBesides: a Core 2 Duo Mac mini with gigabit Ethernet, by the by, would make an _excellent_ little workgroup server.\n\n* **New iLife or iWork: Reply hazy, try again.** I'm skeptical about Apple announcing a new release of their flagship software product(s) at a relatively low-key media event. iLife has been announced at MacWorld every year because it's (in a way) the single most visible point of difference between Macs and other PCs -- the big 40-minute iLife demos are Apple's annual reminder that while Windows PCs can do a bunch of stuff, only Macs come with a whole digital media studio for free.\n\n\tAlso, if they're not going to wait until the next Macworld show in January, wouldn't it make more sense to debut iLife alongside Leopard in October? Maybe even to offer some kind of Leopard/iLife bundle for customers wanting to upgrade all their software in one fell swoop?\n\n\tIt's possible Apple's going to show off iLife today, but announce it for an October release alongside Leopard, now that their longstanding aversion to pre-announcing stuff has been broken (c.f. iPhone). But if they've got new iMacs and a cool new operating system on the way, with at least one iPod/iPhone announcement likely before the end of the year, why muddy the message with an iLife release?\n\n* **New and improved .Mac: He beat me, but I still love him.** Seriously. How many times has the Mac blogosphere gone apeshit over the possibility that .Mac would either stop sucking or just altogether _stop_, only to find it still trucking along as always?\n\n\tI could see Apple upgrading everyone's storage and making some infrastructure improvements. But I don't see them killing .Mac, nor do I see them handing it off to an actual web company like Google or Yahoo. And I _certainly_ don't see any of that happening at today's Apple Event. I would _love_ to be wrong, but I'm doubtful that .Mac is ever going to improve enough to satisfy its many critics.\n\n\t.Mac sucks. They could make it free, or they could make it not suck, but they've had _years_ to do one or the other and yet it continues, like a vermin that refuses to eat its poisoned food pellet.\n\n* **New iPods: Bitch, what I just say?** See above note -- this is a _Mac_ event.\n\n* **New iPhones, new iPhone software, an iPhone SDK or a new line of iPhone-branded jams and jellies: See above.**"

    title: "Notes on a Redesign"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The long, long, long, long-promised Practicalmadness homepage redesign is at long, long last done."
    body: "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://practicalmadness.com/\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-08-01_new_practicalmadness_homepage.jpg\" alt=\"New Practicalmadness Homepage\"></a></p>\n\nUsually when I get all up in yo' grills saying, \"you may have noticed things look a little bit different around here this afternoon,\" I'm talking about some tiny little change that only I notice. Like the Chicago-scape billboard image being replaced by a rotator of pretty photographs, or me having made the layout a few pixels wider.\n\nNot this time. Today I present to you the first (finished, launchable) total redesign of the _Practicalmadness_ homepage since March 2006.\n\n### What's new ###\n\n* If you're a frequent visitor to this site, you may be shocked to learn that _I post new content almost every single day_, even though the article featured on the homepage may only change once every 2-4 weeks. Last year I snuck a linkblog onto the sidebar under the heading \"Recommended,\" and while the purpose of that section (and linkblogs in general) has been to, well, share links in a quick and dirty fashion, some of the posts there can be as chock-filled with Practical goodness as the longer epic-length essays.\n\n\tSo starting today, link posts have been merged into the main blog on the homepage. (They've been part of the RSS feed for a while now.)\n\n\tWhat's more, link posts _actually include the date they were posted(!!!!!)_. In the time it's taken me to add this feature, the Vox friend who asked for it has stopped being my Vox friend! The wait for this feature has outlived an online friendship!\n\n\tWell, the wait is over, former Vox friend! Born-on dating for link posts is *go!*\n\n* Ahem. What was I saying? Oh, yes -- in addition to the regular RSS feed (which, as I mentioned, now contains both essays and links at no extra charge), I'm experimenting with a little [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/)-powered aggregated feed containing both the content from this site and [my Flickr photostream](http://flickr.com/photos/demaree/). You'll find a link to the \"All Things David\" feed over in the left-hand sidebar on the homepage.\n\n* Speaking of RSS feeds, when the crap did [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/) stop charging money for custom domain branding? (Yes, I know the answer is 'after they got bought by Google.' Lemme alone.)\n\n\tI logged in to make a FeedBurner URL for the new aggregated feed, saw that and I was like, \"score!\" So all Practicalmadness RSS feeds (as linked from the homepage) are on their own fancy `feeds.practicalmadness.com` domain. But if you're getting the feed from `feeds.feedburner.com`, no worries -- it's the same crap.\n\n### What's less new ###\n\nIndividual essay/article pages, at the moment, still use the old-school layout. When I have time, maybe this weekend, I'll make up a layout for them which uses the new header and background styles. They won't change much, though -- one reason the March 2006 Revision and its similar-if-slightly-tweaked antecedents survived for so long is because they got the job done.\n\n\n### What's still profoundly broken ###\n\nHere's your _Jeopardy!_ answer: Internet Explorer 6.\n\nAnd here's your _Jeopardy!_ question: \"Which cracked-out legacy browser is not at all supported on this site anymore?\"\n\nTo translate that into something like English, this site is henceforth best viewed in browsers that either do not suck, or suck to a lesser degree than IE 6.\n\nHere's a handy compatibility chart:\n\n<div>\n<table class=\"compatibility_chart\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Suckiness</th>\n\t\t<td scope=\"col\">Doesn't&nbsp;Suck</td>\n\t\t<td scope=\"col\">Sucks</td>\n\t\t<td scope=\"col\">Sucks&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Blows</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Support Level</th>\n\t\t<td>Full</td>\n\t\t<td>Grudging</td>\n\t\t<td>Fuck No</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Browsers</th>\n\t\t<td>Safari (on Mac, Windows, iPhone and that top-secret touchscreen iPod I'm not supposed to be...um, oops), Firefox 2</td>\n\t\t<td>Internet Explorer 7 (on Windows XP or Windows <del>Highway Robbery Edition</del> Vista)</td>\n\t\t<td>Internet Explorer 6 or earlier, Opera (because, come on -- <em>Opera?</em>)</td>\n\t</tr>\n</table>\n<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\n\ttable.compatibility_chart {\n\t\twidth: 500px;\n\t\tborder: 1px solid #aaa;\n\t\tborder-bottom: 0;\n\t}\n\n\ttable.compatibility_chart th,\n\ttable.compatibility_chart td {\n\t\tpadding: 5px 10px;\n\t\tborder-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\n\t\tvertical-align: top;\n\t\tfont-size: 12px;\n\t}\n\n\ttable.compatibility_chart th {\n\t\tbackground: #d4d4d4;\n\t\twhite-space: nowrap;\n\t\ttext-align: left;\n\t\twidth: 100px;\n\t}\n\n\ttable.compatibility_chart td {\n\t\twidth: 120px;\n\t}\n</style>\n</div>\n\n<p>Please tell your friends.</p>"

    title: "Breakfast at Wendy's"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "We take a break from our usual topics of death and nerdery to focus instead on something far more important: breakfast."
    body: "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/892353074/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1235/892353074_48f07ea0d9_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" alt=\"Foil Wrapper\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" /></a>\n\nWe take a break from our usual topics of death and nerdery to focus instead on something far more important: breakfast.\n\nSpecifically, fast food breakfast, something for which I have a vast and irrational love. In my house we never had fluffy pancakes or homemade sausage gravy; a special weekend breakfast was a bagful of breakfast sandwiches from Krystal, Hardee's or McDonalds. And so on those days when I feel like a yoghurt and/or muffin just won't cut it, and a sit-down meal at one of my Preferred Brunch Spots would be overkill, I ride on down to McDonalds and grab the usual: a steak/egg/cheese bagel combo meal, with hash browns and an iced coffee. (I am aware that my arteries will seek revenge later.)\n\nI mention this because Wendy's -- purveyors of the best fast-food hamburger that can legitimately be called a fast-food hamburger, rather than a real hamburger that just happens to come from behind a counter -- are now testing a breakfast menu at some of their Chicago-area locations. And as befits the establishment that invented the Frosty (a dessert that manages to tread the uncanny valley between ice cream and shake), said menu is _fucking weird._\n\nBefore delving into the weirdness, however, let me cut to the chase: Wendy's breakfast is agreeable, sometimes tasty, not altogether a bad value, but not at all worth riding a mile and a half on a bicycle to get. It's not like Hardee's biscuits, which I have driven over ten miles and waited in a drive-thru line for half an hour to get, or even something as bland-but-reliable as a McMuffin. Certainly their offerings are preferable to Burger King's, but only by a sliver.\n\nAnd just so you understand where my priorities lie, _all_ of these fast-food breakfasts pale in comparison to (say) a pastry or breakfast sandwich from Corner Bakery or Au Bon Pain, or the breakfast panini from Milk & Honey on Division St. If a McDonalds breakfast is a compromise, then Wendys' is a compromise of a compromise, a pale simulacrum of the hearty, filling meal you could be having right now, if only there were an extra hour in the day.\n\n### Drill a Hole In That Substrate and Tell Me What You See ###\n\nA wide variety of sandwich rolls is not uncommon in the land of fast-food breakfast: McDonalds, famously, has the generic biscuit, bagel and English Muffin, as well as their own proprietary (and disgusting) McGriddles&trade;. Burger King has Croissan'wich&trade;, and for anything that won't fit on a Croissan'wich&trade; (like the awesomely named Meatnormous Omelet Sandwich) they just use the stale sub rolls they serve their chicken products on.\n\nWendy's breakfast sandwiches come on any of four different substrates:\n\n* A biscuit\n* A \"Frescuit&trade;\", which is what happens when you force a buttermilk biscuit and one of Wendy's \"Frescata&trade;\" sandwich rolls to fuck at gunpoint\n* A hamburger bun\n* A tortilla (for breakfast burritos)\n\nWhy offer both a biscuit and a \"Frescuit&trade;?\" Fast-food biscuits, after all, totally lack the soft flakiness of actual biscuits and end up being crumbly, caky, stale-seeming rolls with way, way too much artificial butter flavoring. A Frescuit&trade; solves this problem by retaining the smooth, crispy outer texture while not even trying to replicate the mealy inside, providing that same ersatz biscuit flavor in a form factor that holds sandwich fixins' better than an ordinary biscuit. It is, in other words, designed to be a superior breakfast sandwich foundation, and therefore should obviate the need for fake biscuits on the menu.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/891508843/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1378/891508843_5a59e520b4_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" alt=\"Frescuit Sandwich\" style=\"float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0\" /></a> So why are they there? If I were to guess, it's the illusion of variety. Wendy's is hoping to distinguish themselves from McDonald's by offering a full dollar menu at breakfast, which includes burrito-, biscuit- and bun-based sandwiches, but no Frescuits&trade;. The Frescuit, rather, is used on only one sandwich (the aptly titled \"Buttermilk Frescuit&trade; Sandwich,\" pictured at left).\n\nI find this odd because the Frescuit&trade; is one of two really awesome things which distinguish Wendys' breakfast offerings from the competition. It's not a culinary triumph by any means, but it's original, distinctive and tasty.\n\nIf you came to this site looking for something germane to the world of software or product development, let me tide you over with this thought: Frescuit&trade;, like Croissan'wich&trade; or McGriddles&trade;, ought to be a platform, not a product. In other words, _the entire menu_ ought to be based around this triumph of artificial breadmaking. An entire breakfast initiative based around a freaky new roll is a bold statement; a single Friscuit&trade;-based sandwich on a menu dominated by crappy biscuits and hamburger buns just seems like a white elephant.\n\nAnd while I'm on the subject of distinguishing features, Wendy's does manage to redeem themselves from their whole Frescuit&trade;-marginalization problem by offering diners _a choice_ of side items with their breakfast combos, just as they do at lunchtime. There's the standard hashbrown, of course, but you can also have either a freakily squared-off blueberry muffin or a dry, semi-terrifying cinnamon roll (pictured below).\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/892354026/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1280/892354026_79bde8a2a4.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" alt=\"Anemic Cinnamon Roll\" /></a></p>\n\nYes, I know -- neither of those options sounds like something I'd actually want to eat, given the option of eating something else instead. You know, like Play-Doh. And since Wendy's Custom Bean coffee is admitted on the menu to be nothing more than glorified Folgers, I might have to recommend just not ordering the combo meals at all unless you're on such a grease bender that a hash brown is worth more than the dollar you'd pay for it _a la carte_.\n\nBut it's the thought that counts, and I give Wendy's points for trying, just as I reserve mad respect for Microsoft for inventing fast user switching so Apple could come along, rip off the idea and actually do it right. Hopefully Wendy's innovative, flexible combo policy will inspire McDonalds to start letting me substitute a fruit salad or yoghurt for hash browns.\n\n<em>Pictured below: the Big Breakfast Sandwich, a regular Wendy's hamburger bun filled with eggs, cheese, bacon _and_ sausage. Oh, the meatnormity.</em>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/891509709/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1017/891509709_e76bb8ec8e.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" alt=\"Big Breakfast Sandwich\" /></a></p>"

    title: "Speaking of Gross Idolatry"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If Rev. Flip wants to live in a nation that was \"made great\" by a divine power, I'm sure they'd love to have him in Iran."
    body: "You may have heard something about this incident in the U.S. Senate yesterday where [three radical-right Christian activists \"disrupted\" the morning invocation][yahoonews] because it was being delivered by a Hindu and not a Christian.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n> Capitol police said two women and one man were arrested and charged with causing a disruption in the public gallery of the Senate. The three started shouting when guest Chaplain Rajan Zed, a Hindu from Nevada, began his prayer.\n\n> They shouted \"No Lord but Jesus Christ\" and \"There's only one true God,\" and used the term \"abomination.\"\n\n[TPM's Election Central blog interviewed Rev. Flip Benham][tpm], the leader of the protesters' anti-abortion activist group, and he praised the yahoo jeering assholes for \"[reminding] the Hindu that there is one God who made this country great, and his name is Jesus.\"\n\nA few thoughts here:\n\nI'm not exactly a card-carrying Christian or anything, but I was raised in the South and I do watch a lot of TV and movies. And as I understand it, Jesus Christ is pointedly _not_ God, neither \"the\" God or \"a\" God. He is rather the son of God, and part of the whole point of Jesus is that he's both fully human and fully divine. His job was to die for our sins, and then to return in judgement at some unspecified future time. And unless there's some passage I missed in the New Testament which obviates the Ten Commandments (more than one of which are about idolatry), Rev. Flip is here both praising a false idol and taking the God's name in vain. My point here isn't to minimize Jesus Christ, certainly. But as I understand it, _the entire point_ of the Messiah is that he's not God. Nor do we need for the Messiah/Savior to be God. We have God for that.\n\nAs for whether it's appropriate for (a) the Senate to even have a morning invocation or (b) for bigoted yahoos to disrupt it, I have a few thoughts:\n\n* While having a morning prayer would seem to go against the spirit of our separation of church and state, it's not like the men and women elected to the Senate leave their religious beliefs at the chamber door when they come into session. If we're gonna get upset about Senate traditions, perhaps we should spend a little more time sweating over things like anonymous holds and filibusters, rather than the small stuff.\n\n* If we didn't have a morning prayer in the Senate, the same people hollering for school prayer would be bitching about Congress being turned into godless heathens by a godless UN conspiracy. Personally I don't think Ann Coulter needs any more money, so it's perhaps best that she have one less thing to complain about.\n\n* I complain about Congress as much as anyone, but unless these people really do plan to overthrow our republican system of government and establish a Christian theocracy under Generalissimo Pat Robertson, they should comport themselves with a shred of decency and do what any polite, not-raised-in-a-barn person would do: write a scathing letter to their Senator, so they can be ignored remotely rather than in person.\n\n* Out of all the dozens of people in the Senate chamber yesterday  morning, including a number of (yes) Senators, only these three morons felt the need to stand up and challenge the Hindu chaplain for being, you know, Hindu. That would seem to be a powerful-if-tacit statement on whether or not their actions were appropriate.\n\nGoing back to Rev. Flip for a moment: can someone explain to me how _any_ God, be it Jesus, Jehovah, Yahweh, Vishnu, Allah or Gene Roddenberry, made this country great?\n\nWhen I was in school I was taught that this country is great because of (a) freedom, (b) democracy, (c) lots and lots of guns and (d) a market economy. And the incidents that led to the _founding_ of this country had less to do with Jesus than with the British crown's draconian enforcement of various unfair trade and taxation policies. It was the money, stupid.\n\nWe became a world power in the first half of the 20th century because we became the world's armorer, banker and reserve army. We expanded our power by becoming the first nation to develop a weapon that could vaporize a city in five seconds, then exporting our mass consumer culture anywhere and everywhere we could.\n\nWhether American influence has been positive or negative is beyond the scope of this argument. My point here is that while there probably is a strong correlation between Protestantism and the desire for independence in the founding fathers, the fuel for the engine of American exceptionalism has been _commerce_, not religion. That a Hindu (or Muslim or Jew or Wiccan or Trekkie) can live in America and enjoy the same inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (not to mention the right to make a buck by any means necessary) -- _that_ is what makes America great, my friends.\n\nIf Rev. Flip wants to live in a nation that was \"made great\" by a divine power, I'm sure they'd love to have him in Iran.\n\n[yahoonews]:http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/congress_usa_prayer_dc;_ylt=AsLCpnOrg5R37OkAq.trwwADW7oF\n[tpm]:http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jul/12/head_of_christian_right_group_calls_hindu_senate_invocation_gross_idolatry\n[airbag]:http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/rats_1.php"

    title: "iPhone Service Secrets Revealed!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "A few things you probably didn't know about the jesus-phone."
    body: "Apple and AT&T have made a couple of service-side iPhone announcements this morning, including the [complete list of iPhone-specific service plans](http://www.apple.com/iphone/easysetup/rateplans.html).\n\nI'll just cut to the chase: these iPhone plans are _identical_ to AT&T's regular rates, except that they have the \$20/mo iPhone Data Plan bundled into the price. (They even show up as separate line items on your order.) This isn't to knock the pricing, of course -- \$20/mo for unlimited data and 200 SMSes is less than I'm paying at T-Mobile, although AT&T's less generous anytime minute allowance makes it less of a bargain.\n\nApple also posted [a video walkthrough of the activation process for iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/usingiphone/activation.html), in which we learn a few interesting things:\n\n* Unlike every (other) iPod to date, you cannot manually manage songs/videos/etc. on the iPhone. You _have_ to sync them. Of course, you can just do what many of us do with our Apple TVs and just create a single playlist for your iPhone stuff and sync that. But you can't, say, take your iPhone to your buddy's house and bring home his collection of Motley Cr&uuml;e b-sides. It has to sync, which means the iPhone can only get its music from _one_ computer.\n\n* On a related note, the iPhone _cannot_ be used as a disk. So if you were planning to buy the 8 GB model thinking you could use all that extra space for documents and crap, think again.\n\n* iPhones have to be activated with AT&T to be used _at all_. You can't just buy one to use as an iPod or with your Wi-Fi connection. It simply will not work unless it's registered with AT&T and Apple.\n\n* While the SIM card is technically removable, the activation process is done entirely through software. Even if you have an existing AT&T phone, you can't just swap your SIM card into the iPhone -- you have to tell AT&T to switch your account over to the iPhone and its built-in SIM card.\n\n* The _entire_ signup and activation process is handled via iTunes; as far as I can tell, not even AT&T salespeople will be handling activations for it in-store. This includes every aspect of switching to the iPhone, including porting your number from another carrier and letting AT&T check your credit.\n\n\tThe really interesting edge case here is gonna be what happens when someone with shitty credit buys an iPhone retail box for \$500-600, brings it home and goes through the whole 15+ screen activation process, only to find that they can't actually use it because AT&T won't give them an account.\n\n\tI wouldn't expect this problem to be at all prevalent, but surely Apple and AT&T have a plan for this. Will they be charging restocking fees to people who bought an iPhone they can't use? Will there be a small number of \"refreshed\" iPhones available at Apple Stores a month from now for 5-10% off retail, returned by people who should have known better than to spend \$600 on it to begin with?\n\n* Speaking of activation and credit: Apple's portion of the activation requires one to have an iTunes Store account. Not just an Apple ID, mind you, but an Apple ID that's registered with iTunes and has at least one form of payment associated with it. So if you're not currently an iTunes user, you'll not only need to give AT&T your SSN for your credit check, you'll need a major credit/debit card to sign up for iTunes.\n\n\t_And yet_ none of this payment information flying around is used for your AT&T service. They still send you a bill, and will probably start harassing you to switch to e-billing within minutes of your iPhone finishing its first sync.\n\n* This part is hilarious: apparently you can sync your iPhone with your [Yahoo! Address Book](http://address.yahoo.com/), via iTunes, but it appears that you can't sync your _local_ address book with your Yahoo! Address Book.\n\n\tAnd you can't, for example, use the iPhone's built-in contacts app to sync with your .Mac Address Book over the internet. You still have to use Tiger's .Mac Sync service to sync your local contacts with the internet, then use iTunes to sync them to your iPhone, which will also sync your Yahoo! contacts, which will need to be managed manually over the web.\n\n\tHopefully I'm wrong, and the built-in Yahoo! sync does include one's local contacts and not just the iPhone, because that could be somewhat useful. Of course, you'd have to have an iPhone to use the Yahoo! sync feature, because apparently it can only be activated from the iPhone's settings screen in iTunes.\n\n\tOh, and the Yahoo! sync features (along with some other iPhone dependencies) were sneakily included in the palindromally numbered Mac OS X 10.4.10 update last week, so Mac users will need to make sure they've run Software Update before proceeding. It's not yet known whether there will be an iPhone-specific iTunes update between now and Friday night.\n\n* Oh, and like every other PDA in the history of the world, the iPhone lacks the ability to create events on more than one calendar. Any calendar events you create on the iPhone are automatically dumped into a predetermined iCal file, which would indicate that you can't specify a destination calendar from the iPhone UI. Which would indicate that it doesn't actually support multiple calendars. Which sucks."

    title: "The Best of All Possible iPhones"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Robert X. Cringely thinks that Apple has a nefarious plan to control the galazy."
    body: "I ordinarily wouldn't bother spending time picking apart something stupid Robert X. Cringely is saying, because he says so many idiotic things and to address them would take up valuable time better spent playing [Desktop Tower Defense](http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/).\n\nBut it's iPhone Week, and he's decided to kick off what could be the biggest week in the long history of moron punditry by arguing that [the iPhone will be a success because Safari for Windows will force companies to adopt the Google Web Toolkit. Or something.](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070622_002278.html) Basically Cringely is taking a very, very mistaken understanding of how \"Web 2.0\" Ajax applications are developed and extrapolating from there.\n\nTake a look at the following excerpt (boldface emphasis mine where added):\n\n> [The iPhone is] a stellar piece of engineering, of course, and nearly as good as Apple claims. There will be early problems, of course, many of them probably related to Apple and AT&T's decision to use the mobile carrier's EDGE network (G2.5) rather than its much faster G3 service. Why hobble with lousy bandwidth a \$500 cell phone?\n\n> Because lousy bandwidth is being viewed inside Apple as the very reason for the iPhone's probable success.\n\n> The iPhone absolutely needs AJAX applications for the phone to be a success on AT&T's EDGE network. By pushing more functional logic into the browser, the bandwidth consumed per http round-trip is significantly reduced, **making the phone apps faster and helping to justify that big price tag.** The problem with this is that AJAX apps don't always work the same (or at all) on every browser. The iPhone has real browser support, which is good, but remember AJAX is based on JavaScript, which in this case is not so good. JavaScript isn't statically typed and each browser has its own version of JavaScript. Developers are typically forced to hand-code different versions of their AJAX apps for different browsers. With the AJAX economy dictating that browsers with big market share like IE and Firefox get most of the effort, that leaves Safari as a second-class browser and, potentially, a liability for the iPhone.\n\n> Whaddayado? Introduce a Windows version of Safari, get a million people to download it in the first week, and scare developers into moving Safari customization higher on their AJAX priority list.\n\n> Where Google comes into this story is with the Google Web Toolkit (GWT), an open source compiler that compiles Java source code into optimized browser-specific JavaScript code. GWT makes writing AJAX apps like writing regular apps in the sense that developers can use many of the tools they are used to. And GWT adds the advantage that the GWT compiler handles all the problems of working with specific browsers.\n\n> Now imagine you are the developer of an AJAX application and you suddenly have an urgent need to support Safari for Windows. The easiest way to accomplish that is through GWT.\n\nSpeaking as both an informed Mac-head and a developer of these Ajax applications, let me break down for you the ways in which this is stupid:\n\nIt is technically true that \"each browser has its own version of JavaScript.\" It's also true that each browser, technically, has its own versions of HTML and CSS. This is because each browser uses its own different _rendering engine_, which is responsible for taking the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code it downloads from a Web site and rendering the beautiful, powerful Web pages they describe.\n\nBut while each browser has a different rendering engine, interoperability is the whole point of the Web. And so HTML, CSS and even JavaScript are treated as \"web standards,\" and each browser's developers make a good-faith effort to support those standards the same way, so that code that conforms to the standard will look and behave identically on any platform.\n\nUnfortunately the browser makers aren't always entirely successful, and in some cases (i.e., IE) they willfully deviate from the standards to make it easier for developers to adopt proprietary extensions or support some legacy crap. For example, ActiveX -- the dreaded IE plugin interface which became known by most users as the way viruses and malware get into a Windows XP install -- is a proprietary web technology developed by Microsoft and _only_ used in Internet Explorer.\n\nMore to the point, when someone says that JavaScript support is flaky and inconsistent from browser to browser, what they really mean is that code that is well-behaved, functional and conformant in Firefox and Safari could flame out spectacularly in IE. And when they say that people often have to write multiple versions of a web site to support different browsers, what they really mean is that people have to write two versions: a standards-based one (for Safari, Firefox, Opera and everyone else), and one for IE.\n\nFortunately for us web developers -- and unfortunately for idiot pundits who are trying to make our job sound harder and more glamorous than it is -- the hardest cross-compatibility issues have already been solved for us via _JavaScript frameworks_. These are sets of special functions you can include in your site or project that provide a common interface for handling such things as Ajax requests and DOM manipulation, that (usually) Just Work no matter what browser the code is running in.\n\nFor example, if I want to hide a particular element on the page, I can just use [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/)'s `Element.hide` method and not have to worry about any browser-specific quirks that may arise, because I know that Prototype is taking care of the compatibility issues. It's not always perfect, and I always have to test and tweak my sites in all three major browsers, but a framework makes that job more like proofreading than like having to engineer totally different solutions for each target browser.\n\nJavaScript frameworks like Prototype or the Yahoo! UI Library differ greatly from the Google Web Toolkit Cringely's so hot about. While Prototype is just a JavaScript file that can be loaded and used on any web page, regardless of what (if any) server-side language it uses, the GWT, as Cringely so very facilely describes it, \"compiles Java source code into optimized browser-specific JavaScript code.\" Whereas I can use Prototype on _any web site I want_, the GWT is useful only for Java-based web applications. To be sure, a _lot_ of companies develop web sites using Java, and so the GWT is useful for a _lot_ of stuff. But if a given web site isn't written in Java, the GWT is useless for that particular web site.\n\nAs for the GWT's magical cross-browser compatibility, while I haven't used it myself (seeing as I don't know Java), I would remind everyone that for the most part Google's own apps -- most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets -- weren't entirely compatible with Safari until the Safari 3 Beta release came out this month. It may be Google's goal to provide full, immediate, top-notch Safari support for all their applications going forward, and to make sure that GWT-generated JavaScript code works as beautifully in Safari as in Firefox. But we're not there yet, and at the present time the GWT is actually a _worse_ solution for the browser compatibility problem for the vast majority of web slingers out there because it's so tightly coupled with Java.\n\nI don't disagree with Cringely that Ajax is a good workaround for the iPhone's limited \"2.5G\" bandwidth and a good thing in general, and that Safari for Windows will be a valuable tool for Windows-based web developers who want to ensure that their apps will run on the iPhone without buying a Mac. And I certainly would agree that the iPhone is going to be a great thing for Google. I agree with all these viewpoints because, well, they're fairly obvious.\n\nWhat's less clear is how one makes the jump from one of these totally obvious viewpoints to saying that because the iPhone kinda _needs_ Ajax due to its less-than-perfect download speeds, it's going to be a success _because_ of Ajax. And I don't mean \"less clear\" in the sense that I disagree with Cringely's logic -- I mean that I fail to see any logic at all here. I mean, he's arguing that because the iPhone lacks 3G, the apparent speediness of Ajax is the only possible justification for the iPhone's \$500 price tag, as if the wireless data services and Safari browser were _the only thing the iPhone does_.\n\nReading his piece I couldn't help but think of Pangloss, and his argument that Candide shouldn't try to save Jacques because the bay of Lisbon had been formed expressly for him to drown in. In this best of all possible worlds, from this best of all possible companies, Cringely just isn't satisfied with the simple explanation: that the iPhone has EDGE instead of 3G because more people have EDGE service than 3G, and that 3G support would likely have added hundreds of dollars to the iPhone's price tag. The iPhone is a great platform for Ajax web sites, and I'm sure Apple considered that when designing the first-gen iPhone.\n\nBut it's not like that was the _only_ consideration or even the most important one. Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes a cigar really is just a cigar.\n\n\n### No, Virginia, The iPhone Won't Replace Your Mac ###\n\nOf course, if you need any more evidence that Robert X. Cringely is either crazy, stupid or both, watch as he announces that the iPhone's beautiful, innovative user interface is in fact intentionally \"hobbled\" so as not to hurt Mac sales:\n\n> Remember that a key component of iPhone marketing is that the device will run a version of OS X, making it more computer than phone...With all that power locked inside, of course some users will want to imagine their iPhone AS their PC, which Apple -- at least for now -- would rather not enable because it might hurt Macintosh sales. So they've hobbled the iPhone with essentially the same crappy text entry capability as on any other phone.\n\n> You can do a lot on an iPhone, but writing the Great American Novel is probably not on the list.\n\nYes, you heard that right: Cringely is arguing that the reason Apple incorporated a QWERTY soft keypad for text entry isn't because it's a standard method that any given user will know how to use right away. No, it's a conspiracy to make the iPhone harder to use so people won't throw their Macs away. And he cites a third-party text input technology called ForWord Input which allows \"users with almost no training to input text with their index finger at 50 words per minute.\"\n\nHe further explains that ForWord Input \"is patented, and comes from developers who already have other applications running in 500 MILLION mobile phones.\"\n\nGee, why on earth would Apple have chosen a QWERTY keypad over such a nifty-sounding technology? Let's take a look, shall we?\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"500px\" align=\"center\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th width=\"50%\">ForWord&nbsp;Input</th>\n\t\t<th width=\"50%\">QWERTY</th>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Requires \"almost no\" training, i.e., <em>some</em> training</td>\n\t\t<td>Requires <em>no</em> training; familiar to anyone who's ever used a computer, smartphone, typewriter, et al.</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Patented, would need to be licensed (i.e., \$\$\$)</td>\n\t\t<td>I'm not sure about its patent status, but I'm pretty sure it's 100% free to use</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Written by developers who have <em>other</em> apps running in 500M mobile phones, but not really in use anywhere yet</td>\n\t\t<td>In use on a few billion smartphones, PDAs, text pagers, computers and, oh, typewriters around the world</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>So new/obscure it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page</td>\n\t\t<td>First developed/patented in 1868</td>\n\t</tr>\n</table>\n\nSo let's set aside for the moment that you have to already own a PC or Mac to use the iPhone, and look at this argument on its own dubious merits. Here he's saying that because the iPhone is as powerful as a Mac and runs the same OS as a Mac, that it therefore should have all the same capabilities as a Mac.\n\nAnd since it doesn't, it couldn't possibly be because Apple's designers feel that a handheld, pocketable device would be used for different things than a desktop PC and therefore requires a different, simpler user interface.\n\nBecause Cringely would apparently want to blind himself trying to write the Great American Novel on a handheld device, he's come to the conclusion that Apple is preventing him from doing so because otherwise he wouldn't buy a Mac, and not because it's a patently stupid idea, or because the alternatives would both cost money and alienate most users who aren't masochistic &uuml;bernerds."

    title: "Indiana Jones: Old Codger"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Harrison Ford is getting too old for this stuff."
    body: "Apparently principal photography has (finally!) started on the long-planned fourth _Indiana Jones_ movie, with Harrison Ford returning to his role as the globe-trotting, whip-snapping archeology professor/adventurer.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mother very often liked to make the following two observations about American pop cinema:\n\n1. She thought Harrison Ford was hot.\n\n2. She thought that Shatner, Nimoy, et al., continuing to play Kirk, Spock, et al., in _Star Trek_ movie sequels well into their sixties looked completely ridiculous. (Tragically, my mother passed away before she could listen to _Has Been_.)\n\nAnd so if my mother were alive today, as much as I'd be loathe to call her and ask a question about movies for fear of getting pushed and guilted into seeing _Chicago_ for the forty billionth time, I would be a little bit curious to see what she thinks of Harrison Ford -- her hero, her secret screen love -- putting on an Indiana Jones costume and jumping around with a whip, well into his sixties.\n\nJust so we're all clear on the chronology here, it's not as if George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford just woke up one morning last spring and said, \"hey, we like money -- why not make another _Indiana Jones_ movie!\" This project has been in the incubator since _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ came out in 1989. There are kids old enough to have sex who are younger than that movie. Hell, _there are kids old enough to vote who are younger than that movie._ And it has taken them this long to get it all together to make the fourth one. (And all we got out of the delay were some _Star Wars_ prequels and, like, _Munich_.)\n\nAnyway, it remains to be seen just how ridiculous the 64 year old Ford will look jumping onto tanks and cracking wise with a bullwhip. Or whether the filmmakers have chosen to work around the fact that their star is a year shy of officially being a senior citizen by having Indy ride around in a golf cart and scold the Nazis. (Or whoever -- the new movie is set in the 1950s. Apparently in a movie universe that includes all kinds of ancient magic and divine fury, Indy having aged 18 years before the end of World War II would be considered \"a stretch.\")\n\nSo to put things in perspective, I took [the first picture of the new 2007-vintage Indiana Jones](http://www.indianajones.com/community/news/news20070621.html) released yesterday and made a little progression:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t<a href=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-06-22_indy_codger_comparison.jpg\" title=\"Larger version of Indy codger comparison photo\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-06-22_indy_codger_comparison.jpg\" width=\"500\"></a>\n</p>"

    title: "It's Not The Watered-Down Corporate Intranet, Just The Corporate Intranet"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "My theory: Apple's insane suggestion that Web 2.0 is the de facto SDK for third-party iPhone apps is nothing more than an olive branch to the one market that might care about not being able to install custom software: corporate IT departments."
    body: "Firstly, I want to say this: I'm pretty sure I'm gonna buy an iPhone. At 6:00 PM on June 29th, you'll most likely find me in line at an Apple Store, ready and willing to put down a quintet (or sextet, even) of my hard-earned Benjamins to take home the latest and greatest effort by those fine software artisans from Cupertino.\n\nAnd then, four months later, I'll do it all again -- yes, indeed, on some fine evening on a date in October TBD, you'll find me in line again, ready to hand over roughly 1.3 additional Benjamins for a copy of Mac OS X Leopard. I do this gladly and enthusiastically, because I'm just one of those crazy Mac people.\n\nThat being said, I think Apple CEO Steve Jobs's announcement that internet-based \"Web 2.0\" applications would be the _de facto_ SDK for the iPhone was one of the most jaw-droppingly stupid things I've heard in my life. And I've had an ex-girlfriend tell me \"witches are real,\" so that's saying a lot.\n\nThe iPhone will be in any number of ways the most complex and challenging product Apple has ever released. It's a whole new UI paradigm, melding the sophistication and power of desktop OS X with the simplicity of an iPod. The thing has to empower the user to perform a myriad of complicated tasks in a way that feels effortless, and has to provide at least the same level of reliability people have come to expect from their commodity cell phones. This is one area where \"well, at least it's better than a Treo\" just isn't going to cut it -- the iPhone has to be spot-on, or it'll be percieved as having failed.\n\nTherefore it shouldn't be surprising or heartbreaking that Apple didn't release or even announce an SDK for the iPhone at WWDC. They've got enough on their plate just getting the thing released on the 29th without having to deal with the inevitable technical and customer support issues that come with an open ecosystem.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs announced the iPhone at Macworld about five months ago, he described it as a \"breakthrough internet communicator.\" And Apple just started running TV ads hyping the iPhone's Safari browser, with a calm, friendly voiceover explaining that the iPhone's version of the internet is \"not a watered down version of the internet, or the mobile version of the internet...it's just the internet.\"\n\nWell, maybe I'm in the minority here, but as I understand it \"Web 2.0\" apps are part of the grown-up internet. And if Mobile Safari can browse the grown-up internet, as they've been telling us for four months, it stands to reason that it can access Web 2.0 apps.\n\nSo why is Steve Jobs using the rarefied \"one last thing...\" spot in his WWDC keynote to tell us that we don't need an iPhone SDK because Mobile Safari supports the latest \"Web 2.0\" standards, something we'd have been shocked to learn _wasn't_ true? Why are they making a point to tell us you can click on a phone number or e-mail address to make a call or send an e-mail, something that all those \"baby internet\" browsers on other phones have supported for years? Why are they expecting us to get excited about _a fucking hyperlink?_\n\n**Because that part of the keynote presentation wasn't really even meant for developers, nor was it aimed at consumers or even investors or analysts. It was instead a first tentative stab at reaching our to the enterprise IT space.** And characteristically for Apple, a company who couldn't find the way into the corporate market with a map, a flashlight, signage and a bunch of people screaming \"HEY! WE'RE OVER HERE!\" to guide them, they managed to water down their message so much that its impact was totally lost.\n\nIt's telling that Apple's big \"iPhone web app\" demo was an internal directory set up to talk to an LDAP database. Why was their ur-example of a third-party iPhone app not a commercial web service like Backpack or even something like Google Reader, but the kind of thing you'd find on a corporate intranet?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think non-corporate users will be able to get lots of good use out of the iPhone's enthusiastic support for modern web apps. But after a keynote almost exclusively dealing with subjects with a lot of consumer appeal -- hot new games, and some flashy new Leopard features -- why not show off some kind of local entertainment guide or yellow pages? You know, something a normal person who _doesn't_ work in a large enterprise might use?\n\nAnd I'm not saying Apple's reaching out to IT departments just because their one demo app was incredibly boring -- I'm also reading between the lines of the bullet points Jobs mentioned when talking up the Web 2.0 support during the keynote. I mean, what market do you think would be most interested in apps that are:\n\n* **\"Secure, like Amazon or a bank.\"** Unless the app in question _is_ Amazon or the user's bank -- both of which, by the way, should work fine on Mobile Safari -- I don't think anyone cares about this unless they're trying to protect their own valuable data.\n\n* **Quick/cheap to develop, like the Apple LDAP app which \"required less than one person-month to build.\"** For one thing, \"person-month?\" I know it's a developer conference, but Apple never talks about their kick-ass APIs in terms of person-months and lines of code, but rather in terms of what you can do with them. \"Person-month\" is a term you use when you're working on a totally solved problem and just need to figure out how long it'll take to get the grunt work done. Consequently it's quite a popular phrase in IT departments.\n\n* **Easy to deploy and update because they don't need to be installed anywhere.** Individual end users don't stress about updating their software because installing or updating one copy of one application is easy. It's tracking and implementing changes to dozens, hundreds or thousands of installations that's hard, and again, this is something that normally falls under the purview of an IT department.\n\n* **Able to hook into all manner of databases (like, say, LDAP, but also Active Directory or a SQL-based database).** Why does it matter that an \"iPhone web app\" can talk to an LDAP directory? If you're developing a brand-new web app specifically for the iPhone, can't you just use whatever data store you want, anything from SQLite to the filesystem, since it's the Web interface that matters and not the backend?\n\n\tYeah, you could -- unless the problem you're trying to solve involves hooking your sales force up to some existing data store. I find it interesting that of all the web apps Jobs could have cited as examples, he chose Salesforce.com, which is possibly the last product I would ever think about in connection with the iPhone or Apple. (Ironically, [Salesforce.com offers native client apps for Windows Mobile, Blackberry and Symbian](http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2007/06/is_iphone_out_o.html), precisely because mobile internet connections are slow, unreliable and intermittent. Good example, Steve.)\n\n* **Completely platform agnostic.** You can choose to read this as a good thing -- more users + less labor = awesome. But when I hear them talking about how the same web app will work on all three Safari target platforms, my mind jumps to the corporate manager who'll be reassured because he won't need to buy any Mac hardware for his IT staff. I hear them saying, \"don't worry -- just because the iPhone runs OS X doesn't make the Mac any less irrelevant.\"\n\n* **Able to easily tap into the iPhone's communications features.** That last bit is a bit of a giveaway, in my opinion. Consumers aren't liable to need to use a web app to get an e-mail address or phone number -- they'd keep those in their local address book, which would be automatically synced over by iTunes. And if they were looking up a business, they'd use the built-in Google Maps app or just run a regular Google search. In other words, nothing requiring a custom web app.\n\nI wouldn't dare speculate on why Apple feels they need to reach out to enterprises. Maybe AT&T is leaning on them to be more business-friendly because they have so many corporate customers. Maybe they have some market research that shows the iPhone at a big disadvantage to Windows Mobile, Symbian and Blackberry because it can't hook into corporate databases. Maybe they think that because Wall Street wanted to hear something about third-party development this week, they should focus on something that Wall Street would understand.\n\nUltimately it doesn't matter. Don't worry, folks -- we shouldn't be offended because Steve Jobs thinks we're stupid. No, we should instead be offended because he was talking _past_ us, talking _around_ us like we weren't even in the room. The upshot of the message, intentional or not, was that Mac developers were irrelevant to the iPhone platform, and the Web is where it's at.\n\nIt's like we've all shown up for a punk show and our favorite band decided that because their new manager's friends like adult contemporary, for their encore they were gonna play an unironic Bryan Adams cover to suck up. \n\nAnd no matter how much the band claims they haven't sold out, no matter how much you loved the rest of their set, you just can't get over the fact that at the moment their fans were most excited, they wanted to be singing for someone else."

    title: "Leander Kahney: Author, Safari Hater, Moron"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In Soviet Russia, browser chooses you."
    body: "_Wired_ magazine contributor and author Leander Kahney (who is also notable for having received at least one of [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/)'s \"Jackass of the Week\" awards) provides this morning's bit of post-Stevenote FUD by asking the musical question: [\"Who in Their Right Mind Would Run Safari on Windows?\"](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2007/06/cultofmac_0612)\n\nKahney writes:\n\n> It makes perfect sense for Apple to release its Safari web browser for Windows, but the question is: What right-thinking Windows user would want it? The initiative seems to rely on a domino theory fueled by infatuation. Apple is hoping there are Windows users so in love with their iPods and iTunes that they will also download Safari. Then they'll fall in love with that, and the next thing you know they'll be down at the Apple Store fishing for their credit cards.\n\nLeander, have you _looked_ at Apple's Mac sales numbers since the iPod started to hit it big in 2003-04? It's not just a domino theory -- the so-called \"iPod halo effect\" is very real. For the first time in memory, Apple is making serious market share gains and is considered a viable alternative to Windows by many consumers. And it's all because of the iPod and iTunes.\n\nIt's one thing to tell people that the Mac is better (by the way, it turns out that wild-eyed zealotry is a turn-off, _Leander_), but iTunes for Windows has given people a chance to experience some Apple goodness firsthand. Why else do you think Apple is patterning the new Finder in Leopard so closely on iTunes 7, complete with Cover Flow? Yeah, sure, it looks like a cool new Finder interface in its own right, but the people it's really supposed to impress are Switchers who are already familiar with iTunes 7.\n\nOh, and if you watched any of Jobs's one-on-one with Mossberg at D: All Things Digital, you may recall him saying that the vast majority of iTunes users on Windows _do not_ own an iPod. This means that they're not just suffering along with iTunes because it came with their cool iPods -- it means that a very, very large number of people have downloaded and adopted iTunes as a cool audio player and jukebox in its own right.\n\n\n### How Many Is \"A Lot?\" ###\n\n> **Kahney:** There's only one problem with that scenario -- Safari sucks. A lot of Mac users won't run the browser (I'm one of them), so why would anyone run it on Windows?\n\nYeah, but let's try and define what we mean here when we say \"a lot.\"\n\nSafari has just under 5% worldwide browser market share. While that's small compared to Firefox's 15% or IE's 78%, it's a remarkable number considering that until yesterday Safari was a Mac-only browser.\n\nAmong visitors to this website -- hardly a representative sample of the broader population, I know, but bear with me -- 24% use some version of Safari, versus 56% on Firefox and 15% on IE. Safari's still seems very much in the minority until you also take a look at the breakdown by platform: my audience is 43% Mac users, and simple arithmetic tells us that among Mac users who read _Practicalmadness_, Safari has a whopping 56% market share.<sup id=\"fnr1-2007-06-12\">[1][1]</sup>\n\nMy audience is small, to be sure, but if anything I think these numbers might be _understating_ Safari's reach. The content on this site is very much focused towards web developers, Mac zealots and other such nerds, who tend not to be very forgiving of craptastic browsers. (See also IE's 15% audience share.) There are likely _millions_ of Mac users who use Safari because it's the default browser who would never look at a site like this one, nor Daring Fireball, nor _Wired_'s \"Cult of Mac\" blog.\n\nWhen I see that 56% of the Mac users who visit this site are doing so using Safari, I don't assume that they're saps who've never gotten around to changing their defaults or who are suffering in silence with a sub-par browser. I assume that they've heard the facts and they're voting \"Safari.\"\n\n### Can You Say \"Solipsistic?\" ###\n\n> **Kahney:** On my Mac, Safari is buggy and unreliable. It's always crashing, and it doesn't offer basic features like remembering all the tabs you have open after you quit (or more likely, after it crashes). Until now, it didn't even warn you before closing multiple tabs, although the new version of Safari fixes this.\n\nWow, _dude_, I'm just boggling at how easily our concept of \"basic features\" changes as time goes on. Remember the late years of the browser wars, when \"basic features\" included an HTML composer, mail client, chat client and some kind of \"push\" crap? Or those first few Safari releases from 2003 that didn't have tabbed browsing?\n\nSession saving is a feature that was introduced in Firefox 2.0. It's a \"basic\" and apparently essential-to-Leander feature that is _less than six months old._ By comparison, Safari 2.0.x has been in the wild for about 26 months.\n\nOh, and in the 2+ years I've been using Safari on Tiger, not to mention the year and a half after it was first released for Panther, I've _never_ had a crashing problem with Safari. I've never even _heard_ of a serious crashing problem with Safari. That doesn't mean one doesn't exist, to be sure, and your mileage may vary. But here you're choosing to overlook three years of good press and any number of other people's viewpoints in order to make the categorical statement that because _your_ Safari crashes all the time, Safari is absolutely crap.\n\nYou know what? You're entitled to that viewpoint. You're a blogger, not a journalist, and I think it's time we embrace some distinction between the two, or else I'm going to need to find three sources next time I call someone a moron, an asshat or an sewage-sucking douchebag in this space.\n\nBut let me make a suggestion: next time you're confused as to why anyone would use a piece of software you consider to be buggy, crashprone donkey shit, maybe you should try _asking somebody_.\n\n\n### In Soviet Russia, Browser Chooses You ###\n\n> **Kahney:** For Windows users, the browser market is already far too crowded -- who needs anything other than Internet Explorer or Firefox? Safari is one browser too many.\n\nI'm sorry, what? _What?_\n\nDid the U.S. government not _sue_ and _threaten to break up Microsoft_ because they used their Windows monopoly to limit consumer choice and essentially drive Netscape out of business? Was there not a very long and passionate conversation about the fact that people don't have _enough_ choice when it comes to web browsers? Hasn't Firefox's biggest hurdle over the past five years been getting people even to _know_ that they're not limited to just IE, that they even _can_ switch to a different browser if they want?\n\nYou're saying that Safari shouldn't be on Windows because then there would be _too many_ choices in the browser market? And you're saying this with a straight face?\n\n> These days, browsers are taken for granted -- you can't even give this stuff away.\nBut I'm sure there will be millions of downloads by looky-loos curious to see if Safari is better. One developer at WWDC suggested Safari might be more secure than IE if it doesn't run ActiveX controls (ActiveX is a source of much malicious code).\n\nYep -- _millions of downloads_, and yet you're not expecting a sizeable number of people to switch. And some guy suggests that Safari _might_ be more secure than IE _if_ it doesn't run ActiveX controls, yet you're still not seeing _any_ reason why people would want to use Safari over their current browser.\n\nBy the way, Leander, IE is the _only_ browser that runs ActiveX controls, and I think even Microsoft considers it a legacy feature these days. And if anyone at WWDC is realistically wondering whether Safari would support ActiveX, that person is obviously a suit, a janitor or someone who has never used the Web in his life. Even my late mother, who died two years ago, knew that ActiveX controls were a bad thing, and that Firefox was good because it didn't support them.\n\n> Of course, Apple has good reasons to offer Safari to Windows users. The company has little to lose. It may gain new users, and there's no danger that Microsoft will try to crush Apple like it crushed Netscape -- the browser wars are over. Plus, Apple is more likely to take market share from Firefox than IE.\n\nWell, they _were_ over. Microsoft isn't the threat, though I disagree that Apple is more likely to take market share from Firefox. Most people who've switched to Firefox have done so for a reason, and while I do expect that some Firefox users will want to switch to Safari, Apple's real target here is the vast majority of PC users who are still using IE. Safari's a much simpler and dare-I-say _prettier_ browser than IE or Firefox, and it's faster than either of them to boot. (And I can confirm this from experience; see below for a _brief_ Safari 3 for Windows review.)\n\nAnyway, to suggest that Microsoft's \"crushing\" power would even be a factor at this point is ridiculous. The era of Microsoft's tyrannical control of the entire software industry is over. They're still a major power, to be sure, but consumers now realize that they have choices and are exercising their freedom of choice and voting with their wallets.\n\nIf anything, Microsoft may have indirectly _encouraged_ Apple's entry into the Windows browser market. For years, Windows Media Player has been bundled with Windows, and last fall Microsoft released the Zune Desktop software. If Windows users were really mindless automatons who aren't at all seduced by Apple's wares, WMP/Zune would be the dominant music player.\n\nI'm sure they're also thinking about the halo effect, yes, and about the affiliate revenue they'll get from Safari's built-in Google/Yahoo search box. But do you know what the dominant music player on Windows is? It's iTunes. If nothing else, maybe Apple's thinking here is this: _if we can kick Microsoft's ass in music players, where their offering wasn't total shit, just imagine how many users we'll pick up taking on IE._\n\n\n## Thoughts on the Safari 3 Beta ##\n\nI've been running the Safari 3 Beta on both my main Mac and my main Windows (virtual) machine since it came out yesterday, and I've got a few brief comments:\n\n* Oh god _yes_, it is so nice to finally have draggable tabs in Safari. As much as I'd love for Apple to have announced an iPhone SDK or some hot new hardware yesterday, I could be happy just with this one new feature.\n\n* In case you haven't heard elsewhere, just because the Safari 3 Beta is out for Tiger does _not_ mean we're rid of brushed metal just yet. The Mac version still uses the same metal chrome as the current version, while the Windows release features the new \"iTunes dark gray\" look that will, as of Leopard, be the default UI theme for Mac OS X. Even on Windows, Safari has never looked better. For us Mac users, October cannot get here quickly enough.\n\n* I don't have any benchmarks or anything for this, but Safari 3 is noticeably faster than its predecessor, especially when it comes to Ajax stuff. If you want to see for yourself, just check out some Ajax-heavy web apps like Gmail, Google Maps or .Mac's Mail or iDisk web interfaces -- you'll notice a speed boost. (And just think about this code running on the iPhone's Safari browser and try to keep from smiling like an idiot. This is gonna rock.)\n\n* Some people have noted crashing bugs on both platforms, but I haven't had any yet.\n\n* The most remarkable thing about the Windows port of Safari is that Apple is _not_ using Windows's \"ClearType\" text aliasing technology, but rather have brought over some of the same anti-aliasing software we're used to from OS X. The result is browser text that looks night-and-day better than either Firefox or IE 7 on XP. I'd hope/think the difference is less stark on Vista, but still -- Windows Safari looks great, and will surely make some lucky Windows users very happy.\n\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2007-06-12\">\n<p>Note that I'm not yet correcting for Windows Safari in these numbers, which I guess I'll now have to start doing. But Safari/WebKit user-agent strings with a build number over 500 (which would indicate either a Safari 3 beta or a <a href=\"http://webkit.org/\">WebKit nightly build</a> account for less than 1%, so there wouldn't be a huge change in the audience share if adjusted for Safari on Windows.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2007-06-12\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n[1]: #fn1-2007-06-12"

    body: "## DHH Does Yr Keynotes ##\n\nAfter an ukelele-and-TextMate-themed intro by Rich and Chad from RubyCentral, the king of arrogant bastards himself -- Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson -- has taken the stage. The sweet candy center of his talk today will be the bright shiny future -- Rails 2.0 -- but first DHH is gonna take a page from Steve Jobs's playbook and \"celebrate what we have.\"\n\nYou know Rails has arrived when recruiters are posting jobs and asking for \"3 years Ruby on Rails experience.\" (For all my non-nerd readers, the joke is that Rails hasn't even _existed_ for three years yet.)\n\nAnother marker of Rails's success: an increasing number of companies developing and selling products, such as IDEs, aimed specifically at Rails developers.\n\nOkay, about Rails 2.0:\n\n* **Rails 2.0 will not be a unicorn.** It will be real. More to the point, it won't be a total rewrite -- evolution, not revolution. 95% of what is being shown today works _today_ in Edge Rails.\n\n* Last year, DHH talked about \"a world of resources,\" introducing RESTful routing and ActiveResource. The World of Resources (WoR) is \"a better, greener place\" for Rails development. REST is now a convention in Rails. Scaffolds are switching to the REST model in Rails 2. RESTful Rails apps that `respond_to` XML are ActiveResource-ready out of the box. Pass a `:params` hash into ActiveResource for searching/filtering AR responses.\n\n* ActiveResource isn't announcementware anymore: the Highrise is entirely RESTful (and 37signals's official wrapper class for its API uses ActiveResource), and apps like Fluxiom and Shopify are already using it in production. **ActionWebService is being de-bundled from Rails Core.** It'll still be available as a separate gem, but will be replaced by ActiveResource as the preferred approach to Rails web services.\n\n* **Friends and allies:** Ajax and REST are already first-class citizens of the Rails nation. Next up: DHH says Atom should be incorporated into core eventually, and OpenID should be seen as a major ally if not quite yet essential enough to become part of the framework proper.\n\nNine other highlights: \n\n* **Breakpoints are back!** And better than ever! I need to learn more about this!\n\n* **HTTP performance!** Because no, it's not fast enough! And a myriad of well-separated CSS and JavaScript files kills browser load times! Check this out!\n\n\t`<%= javascript_include_tag :all, :cache => true %>`\n\t\n\tThis collates (and gzips?) all your JS (or CSS, via `stylesheet_link_tag`) files so all your browser includes can load in just two HTTP requests.\n\t\n\tAlso, apparently browsers behave more efficiently if images are coming from multiple hosts, so now `asset_host` can now be wildcarded: `asset%d.highrisehq.com`.\n\t\n* **Query caching!** See Ryan Daigle's blog for more info on this cool new feature.\n\n* **New naming conventions for views!** The `.rhtml` and `.rxml` extensions have been deprecated. Instead, views are named in the format `action.format.renderer`. For example, the view for the `rss` format of the `index` action would be `index.rss.builder`.\n\n* **Initializers!**\n\n* **Sexy Migrations!** Inspired by [Hobo](http://www.rubyinside.com/new-release-of-hobo-the-rapid-web-application-builder-for-rails-434.html) and [PJ Hyett and Chris Wanstrath's plugin](http://errtheblog.com/post/2381), Rails 2's sexy migrations streamline the syntax for creating or modifying tables.\n\n* **HTTP Authentication!** Now in core!\n\n* **The MIT assumption! Or: licenses are hard!** The plugin generator now provides an MIT license file by default.\n\n* **Spring cleaning!** Or: no, we weren't kidding about those deprecation warnings! And some things like in-place editing macros are being moved out of core to plugins.\n\nAnd that's it! No more keynote!\n\n\n## Introduction ##\n\nHey, I'll be updating this post throughout the day with thoughts and comments on the speakers, keynotes, convention center food and -- of course -- all the hottest spring nerd fashions.\n\nA few reminders before we start the day:\n\n* To get caught up on my general conference plan, check out Wednesday's [big RailsConf post][pmrc].\n\n* I'll be Twittering throughout the day. If you want the digital equivalent of that guy who always made snotty asides in homeroom, head over to [my Twitter profile][twitter] and friend me.\n\n* After an unfortunate baggage mishap at Sea-Tac, [the buttons have arrived!][buttons] I have a bunch of button sets and more than enough loose extras to supply the Rails community with maximum buttonage. Practical buttons will be available from me or at the [Blue Box](http://www.blueboxgrp.com/) booth in the exhibit hall, while supplies last. (And about that: there are now less than 200 button sets and maybe 230 extra individual buttons. There are over 1600 people attending RailsConf this year. I may be only one man and they may be only one booth, but still -- the odds are good that the buttons will not last long.)\n\n* Speaking of our friends at Blue Box, yesterday they announced [a way-cool partnership with FiveRuns][5runs-bb] through which B.B. and other hosting companies (including Engine Yard) will be reselling FiveRuns's excellent Rails monitoring tool. Good stuff.\n\n* I feel compelled to mention this as part of my general Joyent fixation: yesterday was not just the opening day of RailsConf, but also the third anniversary of TextDrive's original VC200 lifetime hosting offer. And so they're doing something absolutely batshit crazy: [offering 200 lifetime Joyent Accelerator accounts][batshitcrazy]. \"Small\" Accelerators (256 MB memory, normally \$45/mo) are \$799 for new customers and \$399 for existing Joyent lifers. \"Medium\" ones (512 MB, \$75/mo) are going for \$1299 and \$649, respectively. And current VC/MG/3ML lifetime users _don't_ have to trade in their existing lifetime accounts to get an Accelerator. However, the offer is only being extended to 200 people, first come first served.\n\n\tAn Accelerator, BTW, is basically a Solaris-powered VPS. So they're talking about selling you a lifetime of _private, unmanaged Solaris hosting_ for as little as \$400. My experience with Accelerators is that they're a fantastic server platform with some of the worst customer support in the industry in terms of effectiveness -- the Joyeurs are all _super-nice_ folks, but unfortunately all the niceness on the West Coast won't help me get Apache fixed when it randomly quits proxying and I've been waiting on a ticket response for 48 hours.\n\t\n\tStill, for hobbyists who just want a sandbox or an excuse to mess around with Solaris, this pricing cannot be ignored.\n\t\n* Oh, and Joyent CEO David Young: I noticed that you friended me on Twitter, and you may have noticed that I friended you back. Yay Twitter! Anyway, I've (respectfully) got a bone to pick with you about that 48-hour trouble ticket thing. If you see a largish man with graying, unkempt hair and a brown wool Timbuk2 bag wandering around, come over, say hi and get some buttons. I know that largish, graying and unkempt doesn't really help much around here, but I don't think there are too many brown wool Timbuk2s flying around.\n\nMore to come later, folks. Enjoy RailsConf!\n\n[pmrc]:http://practicalmadness.com/2007/05/practical_at_ra\n[buttons]:http://practical.cc/railsconf_07\n[railsconf]:http://railsconf.org/\n[twitter]:http://twitter.com/ddemaree/\n[5runs]:http://www.fiveruns.com/\n[5runs-bb]:http://www.prwebdirect.com/releases/2007/5/prweb527130.htm\n[batshitcrazy]:http://joyeur.com/2007/05/16/celebrating-textdrives-three-years"

    title: "Practical at RailsConf '07"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " Your humble narrator presenting some valuable information at RailsConf &lsquo;06. In which I belabor a dumb Stephen Hawking reference because I&#8217;m supposed to be on a plane in 10 hours and I&#8217;m a little punch drunk. Or: It&#8217;s RailsConf..."
    body: "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-05-16_david_at_railsconf_06.jpg\" alt=\"David at RailsConf 06\">\n\t<span style=\"display:block;margin-top:0.5em;font-size:11px;\">Your humble narrator presenting some valuable information at RailsConf &lsquo;06.</span>\n</p>\n_In which_ I belabor a dumb Stephen Hawking reference because I'm supposed to be on a plane in 10 hours and I'm a little punch drunk.\n\n## Or: It's RailsConf All The Way Down ##\n\nThe second annual [RailsConf](http://railsconf.org/) (Ruby on Rails Conference) will be held at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland next weekend (Thursday May 17 through Sunday May 20), and of course your humble narrator will be there to learn stuff, take pictures and attempt to schmooze, network and hopefully land a few new clients.\n\nI'll also be spending at least a little time hanging around the [Blue Box Group](http://www.blueboxgrp.com/) booth in the exhibit hall (in my capacity as a consulting Rails Ninja for them), answering questions and talking up how Blue Box's hosting services are way more hella awesome than the more expensive offerings at Rackspace, Joyent and so on. (By the way, if you want to see someone turn purple with rage before your very eyes, just pop on over to the booth or track me down in one of the conference rooms and ask me something about Joyent.)\n\nJust to clarify: **I am not speaking at this year's conference.** Like the fella says, I'm just another passenger on this here boat. However, I will be coming with some cool stuff to talk about in the hallways, corridors and foyers:\n\n* **Scalability:** Over the last couple of months I've been working on a major community site for a certain cable TV network, which was my first time being involved with a Rails app that needed to be hosted on more than one physical machine. And in the process of scaling this app, I learned to hate Rails just a little teeny bit. No, no, I'm not going to start bashing Rails or claiming that it categorically does not scale. The problem is that ActiveRecord never uses one simple query when three will do, and when you're running over a thousand MySQL queries of varying degrees of complexity over the network every second, it _does_ actually become a problem that `@my_object.save` inserts/updates every parameter at once, or that the incrementer query for `counter_cache` relies on the DB server to crunch its numbers. Unlike some other folks, I don't claim to have the one true scalability answer -- I don't actually believe there is one -- but I can lend some experience and maybe clarify a couple of things.\n\n* **Plugins and Design Patterns:** Since last year's RailsConf, I've simply fallen in love with making Rails plugins. There's my [taggable\\_shizzle](http://svn.practical.cc/plugins/taggable_shizzle) plugin, which is basically a fork of `acts_as_taggable` that fixes a few quirks and makes it easier to incorporate tagging into forms or to use a tag class _other_ than `Tag`. Then there's [has\\_file\\_attachment](http://svn.practical.cc/plugins/has_file_attachment), my version of the whole `file_column` or `attachment_fu` concept for associating uploaded files with database rows. Oh, and let's not forget my latest experiment, [metabox](http://svn.practical.cc/plugins/metabox), in which I hack the ActiveRecord database connection plumbing to force Rails to talk to a second, read-only database server (e.g., for master-slave replication scenarios). And there are tons of little extensions I've made that haven't made it into one of my plugins yet, like my `return_on_save` instance method for ActionController::Base that encapsulates the familiar \"if @obj.save redirect, else render\" design pattern to eliminate dozens of lines of un-DRY code from my projects.\n\n* **REST, Namespaces and Admin Interfaces:** One of my rejected talk proposals for this year's conference was about building RESTful admin interfaces for my clients' apps. It was rejected with good reason -- I put the proposal/abstract together in ten minutes and it sucked -- but I do still have some things to say on the subject of creating dual interfaces for the same content without sacrificing the simplicity and elegance of Rails's REST paradigm. In other words, I've been doing a *lot* of work figuring out ways to give my end users their own easy-to-use admin/control panel interfaces without building what's essentially a whole separate app stashed off in a namespace.\n\n\tBy the way, I have some seriously mixed feelings about some of [the new namespace hotness](http://railstips.org/2007/4/28/namespaces-added-to-routes) that's been recently added to Edge Rails. I'm really loving the ability to namespace my models, and there are definitely times when it makes sense to namespace a set of controllers. Building an admin interface is _not_ one of those times, and by making it easier to have your admin namespace cake and eat it RESTfully I'm worried that the Rails Core has just opened a Pandora's Box full of lazy, shitty architectural decisions. We'll have to see how this plays out.\n\t\n\n## It's Buttons All The Way Down ##\n\nIn addition to my knowledge, wit and charm, I'm also bringing to Portland something very, very special: _buttons_. [Rails-themed Practical buttons.](http://practical.cc/railsconf_07/)\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://disk.practical.cc/public/nonsense/rc_buttons/buttons_final.png\"><img src=\"http://disk.practical.cc/public/nonsense/rc_buttons/buttons_final.png\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n\nTo celebrate the occasion of the conference (as well as announce and promote your humble narrator's web development business), I will be distributing 200 packaged button sets. I'll also be bringing along some loose extras, so there'll be plenty of buttons to go around. They're all 1&rdquo; buttons with the Practical name and URL printed on the edges. The designs are by yours truly, with the actual button printing done by our friends at Chicago's own [Busy Beaver Button Co.](http://busybeaver.net/)\n\n\"Wow, jeepers, Mr. Nemesis,\" you might be saying, \"how do I get a set of these wondrous buttons?\" It's quite simple: just come on over and ask for them. To be honest, I'm going to try to make sure the bulk of the sets end up in the hands of people who might hire me to do some work, but I will have _two hundred_ of the adorable little things.\n\nMy objective: to not be able to turn my head in a conference room or corridor on Sunday without seeing at least one person wearing one of my buttons. (And also to raise the profile of Practical Creative &amp; Code and establish my small shop as a player in the Rails consulting space, of course.)\n\n\n## It's Twitters All The Way Down ##\n\nI'm anticipating this weekend to be almost sickeningly _digital_. I'll be taking along my whole Nikon camera rig, and I expect to be Flickring and Twittering and vomiting up all kinds of ephemeral networked detritus for you until at last I slouch back to Chicago Monday night wearing a big sign that says \"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT TONIGHT'S _HEROES_\".\n\nIf you want real-time updates from my conference-going, head over to [my Twitter page](http://twitter.com/ddemaree/) and friend me. Likewise, if you want to see new RailsConf photos as they're posted, head over to [my Flickr stream](http://flickr.com/photos/demaree/) and look for the `RailsConf07` tag.\n\nSee y'all in Portland!"

    title: "Ten Thoughts About Spider-Man 3"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " He&#8217;s still your friendly neighborhood superhero, so long as your neighborhood is Williamsburg. It&#8217;s emo Spider-Man! One would think that details of the plot of Spider-Man 3 would be almost impossible to avoid at this point: if you didn&#8217;t..."
    body: "<p style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em;width:200px;\">\n\t<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-05-05_spider_man.jpg\" alt=\"Your friendly neighborhood Emo Spider-Man!\" style=\"\">\n\t<span style=\"display:block;margin-top:1.5em;font-size:10px;\">He's still your friendly neighborhood superhero, so long as your neighborhood is Williamsburg. It's <em>emo Spider-Man!</em></span>\n</p>\n\nOne would think that details of the plot of _Spider-Man 3_ would be almost impossible to avoid at this point: if you didn't hear it from me, you'd hear it from some other blogger, or maybe from some obnoxious people talking as they left the theater.\n\nHowever, as I care about your delicate sensibilities, Reader, be advised that while the following isn't a plot summary, I won't be shy about spoilers. Consider yourself warned.\n\n1. **For those of you who just want to know, \"is it awesome?\" Yeah, it's pretty awesome.** I continue to love Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spidey, the action scenes and visual effects are flawless, and a scene where J. Jonah Jameson (as portrayed by the incomparable J.K. Simmons) is forced to haggle with a little girl for her camera might be worth the price of admission all by itself.  \n\n   That being said, If _Spider-Man 2_ was like an exquisite meal at a world-class restaurant you've wanted to visit all your life, _Spider-Man 3_ is like one of the nicer buffets in Vegas. While still very tasty, none of the individual morsels are of quite the same caliber. But even if it's not a relevatory meal, it's still nice and satisfying, and boy golly -- there sure is a lot of it.\n\n2. **In particular, the villainage was less satisfying here than in the last movie.** I think that's because both major villains were, well, giant CGI monsters that only occasionally turned into human actors. Doctor Octopus is one of those comic book villains I've never been wild about (\"Ooh, robot arms! Not scary!\"), but Alfred Molina's performance as Ock was great. And I think one cares about (and/or fears) Doc Ock a little bit more because you can see his face. I really like both Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace's performances in this movie (as Sandman and Venom, respectively) -- I just wish I'd seen a little more of them, and less of the giant improbable sand monster.\n\n3. **One of the most amazing things about these _Spider-Man_ movies is the way they can power right through my general Kirsten Dunst dislike and make me care about Peter and MJ.** That being said, those theater critics who put MJ into a borderline annoying funk for the whole movie had a point about Kirsten's singing voice. During the opening musical number, more than once I caught myself thinking, \"well...at least she's really hot in that dress.\" Forget about runaway cranes: the greatest acts of heroism Peter Parker performed were his interrupting MJ's vocal stylings for the good of America. (Twice!)\n\n4. **On a related subject: _musical numbers? Dance numbers?!_** To borrow a line from another character in another comic book from another publisher: Great Caesar's Ghost! Was there no way we could have traded a minute or two of the great Hipster Dress-Up Peter jazz-stravaganza for, say, a little more J. Jonah Jameson?\n\n5. **So, there's a scary black _thing_ (a symbiote, in the parlance of the movie) that falls from outer space**, which turns nerdy nice guy Peter Parker into a wannabe emo dickhead, and turns Evil Topher Grace into More Evil Topher Grace with a giant gaping maw. And they established through the use of instant-replay flashback action that when Spidey went up to that oh-so-symbolic belltower, he didn't yet know that the alien blob was sensitive to loud ringing sounds (a [Chekhov's Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun) that would come into play during Spider-Man's final showdown with Venom).\n\n   But in the comics, Spidey had been aware of the alien's sound weakness for a while, and chose the belltower precisely to weaken the creature's hold on him. This raises the question: apart from taking the whole \"Goth Spidey\" thing to a whole new level of absurdity, why would Peter have chosen that particular venue to rid himself of the black costume?\n\n   In my opinion they did that whole thing backwards: Spidey should have stumbled onto that weakness earlier in the story (say by having Sandman accidentally ring a pipe, which would have caused the alien to freak out), and flashed back to _that_ moment as justification for going to the belltower. And from that point on, the audience would understand that sound hurts the creature, so when Spidey discovers that the ringing of those pipes at the construction site also hurts the creature, we'd understand why without further explanation.\n\n   And more importantly, we'd have a reason (apart from cheap, easy religious symbolism) for why Peter chose the belltower of a church to get rid of the thing. (By the way, in case you're wondering, _Venom's_ origin story -- where Brock bonds with the alien creature in that church -- is taken directly from the comics, though originally he came there days or weeks after Spidey had presumably killed the alien.)\n\n6. **Once you get past those top four or five Spidey villains -- you know, the ones we've already seen in the movies -- [the rest of them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_villains) just totally _suck._** The Vulture? An old man with robot wings who robs banks and hates Spider-Man? What the fuck is up with that? Unless Sam Raimi's got a good way to [retcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon) Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin back to life, there's just not much else to be done here.\n\n   I suppose if they insist on further sequels, now that _Drive_ has been cancelled and Dylan Baker is back to looking for work I propose an all-animal rogues gallery for _Spider-Man 4_. For example, Baker's Dr. Connors can (_fucking finally!_) turn into The Lizard.\n\n  And since apparently one villain isn't enough, we can bring back MJ's astronaut ex-fiancee John Jameson, who in the comics was transformed into Man-Wolf. Yes, seriously.\n\n   Hey, maybe the Osborns' butler could pick up some of that Goblin technology he's _known about all along_(!) and become (duh duh _duh_) the Vulture! An old man with robot wings who robs banks and hates Spider-Man! _Brilliant!_\n\n   And what's the only way to top a movie with three villains? That's right -- _four villains!_ But who else is left? I know -- they should call in..._the [Rhino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_%28comics%29)._ He's a poor Russian immigrant with a super-strong polymer bonded to his skin, who mostly (wait for it...) robs banks and hates Spider-Man. Totally original! Not stupid at all!\n\n   The Lizard has some minor potential, and in a series that began with a genetically enhanced spider and ended with a man turning into a living sand cloud, I don't think having Peter's science professor mysteriously turn into a Hyde-like reptilian alter ego is all that far-fetched. But he's the bottom of the barrel -- after him, all that's left are folks like Electro, Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter.\n\n   And the Rhino. Oh my god, do not get me started on the fucking Rhino.\n\n7. **Speaking of retcons, _Spider-Man 3_ has got to be the most un-selfconsicously _meta_ movie I've seen in many a year.** Not only did they retcon Uncle Ben's death in the first movie to involve Flint Marko/Sandman, they then _retconned the retcon_ to show how it wasn't so much Marko's fault as, y'know, society's. And I'm like, _whoa -- it's turtles all the way down!_\n\n   And the bit about Spidey's upside-down kiss with Gwen Stacy is a perfect example of this franchise [eating itself](http://www.kottke.org/06/11/delicious-will-eat-itself). The upside-down kiss was the signature moment of the first movie, telling us that Spidey isn't just a cartoony action hero -- he's a sex machine who makes out in the rain with a soaking-wet, smoking hot redhead. It is, in short, the scene that gets your girlfriend who hates comic books to come to the movie.\n\n   If Spidey had simply made out with Bryce Dallas Howard upside down, that would just be a case of a second sequel trying to relive past glories, which would have been a different, less appealing kind of intertextuality. That Peter/Spidey did it to play to a crowd of apparently mostly young women seems like a sly commentary on the marketing for the previous movies, and how Sony, et al, have wielded that one moment as a cudgel for the last five years.\n\n8. **Bruce Campbell's cameo as the French _maitre'd_ must be added to the list of things that were awesome.** You might think that to single out what's basically a _Monty Python_ sketch in the middle of a massive \$270M action-adventure spectacle is to underscore just how unaffecting all the crazy CGI mayhem really is, or how little one cares about the whole MJ-reacting-poorly-to-Spidey's-fame subplot. Call it what you like -- I call it _hilarious_. \n\n   Less appealing was _Spider-Man_ co-creator [Stan Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee)'s appearance as an old guy who says something to Peter about Spider-Man and how one guy can make a difference. Lee has spent most of the last forty years cultivating his image as the mastermind of the Merry Marvel House of Ideas, and he's been honored with shout-outs and cameos in almost every modern movie based on his characters, not to mention appearances in Kevin Smith's _Mallrats_, the awesome comics-inspired TV series _Heroes_ and even his own reality series, _Who Wants To Be A Superhero?_. He's one of those pop culture figures who, like William S. Burroughs, doesn't have to say a damned word to be recognized by the faithful (or, in my case, the annoyed).\n\n   That Stan Lee walks up to Tobey-as-Peter, makes a pronouncement about the character/franchise he brought into the world, then utters his own longtime catchphrase (\"'Nuff said.\") is a masturbatory moment that took me completely, if briefly, out of the movie.\n\n9. **But let's address the big improbable sand monster in the room -- _Spider-Man 3_'s record-beating (estimated) \$270 million budget.** Yes, that astonishing high number is a new low for the major movie studios and their belief that the best way to advance the moviegoing experience is to make moviemaking so expensive that viewers' choices are limited even in major markets to megasequels, Will Ferrell comedies and tiny indie video films. (Outside of major markets, you can strike the indie films.)\n\n   But if we're gonna be stuck with nothing but megasequels, we can only hope they're all at least as good as this one. _Spider-Man 3_ won't surprise anyone, but it satisfies, and unlike some previous budget-breakers I could name (_ahem Titanic ahem_) I didn't spend that two hours and twenty minutes thinking about how we could end poverty in America with the money they spent making authentic reproduction newel posts.\n\n10. **Finally, an appreciation of Tobey Maguire.** It's one thing to embody a character in a way that recalls all your fond, distant memories of them from childhood. What distinguishes Maguire's performance as Peter Parker is how it's an _adaptation_ of Spidey's everyman identity. He's not some plasticised ideal of what we ought to identify with, like Clark Kent is -- Tobey plays Peter with a mix of real-world optimism and longing we can all relate to. The comics tell us Spidey is burdened by his responsibility to help people, but the movie character created by Maguire, Raimi and the screenwriters make us believe it. This third movie could have been made for a buck ninety-five with a cardboard cutout standing in for the Sandman and I still would have shown up.\n\n   However, if I could make one recommendation to Tobey Maguire, it would be this: have your agent find you a role playing a child-molesting cancer patient who wins a bicycle race or something, _stat_, lest you fall victim to always being \"that kid who played Spider-Man.\" Follow the example of some actors who've starred in big, recent megafranchises. Like Christian Bale, who spends his off-_Batman_ years playing a variety of complex, often disturbing characters, such that he's already thought of as a Serious Actor who just happened to take a job playing Batman to pay the bills. Or like former hobbits Elijah Wood and Domninic Monaghan, whose first post-_Lord of the Rings_ roles were as a creepy semi-stalker (Wood, in _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_) and a junkie (Monaghan, on _Lost_).\n\n   And whatever you do: _do not even think about doing_ Spider-Man 4. Because while I liked this movie a whole lot, watching a guy in his mid-30s pretend to be a young kid too busy fighting the Lizard, the Vulture, the _goddamned mother-loving Rhino_ and this viewer's total indifference to Kirsten Dunst to help his girlfriend overcome her rejection issues just sounds like a hollow pursuit. Just a suggestion."

    title: "Coda on Rails"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " Years ago &#8212; and I don&#8217;t recall exactly how this came up in conversation recently, but it did &#8212; I was talking to my mom about replacing our refridgerator. I&#8217;ve always been a gadget nut, so naturally I wanted..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-25_coda_icon.png\" alt=\"Coda leaf icon\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1.5em 1.5em\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" />\nYears ago -- and I don't recall exactly how this came up in conversation recently, but it did -- I was talking to my mom about replacing our refridgerator. I've always been a gadget nut, so naturally I wanted one of those fridges that an ice and water dispenser in the front. But my mother explained that while an ice dispenser was certainly a cool feature, she had to think about what would happen if the thing ever broke, and as she saw it the ice dispenser was little more than an extraneous moving part that brought chaos to an otherwise orderly system. These are my words, by the way; her phrasing was about as sophisticated as the fridge we ended up with.\n\nThis story more or less sums up how I feel about all-in-one [IDEs (integrated development environments)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for web development. Sure, it's convenient to have all your tools in one window, just as it's nice to be able to get your ice from outside the refridgerator door. But in my experience, there's always something that makes them more hassle than they're worth.\n\nThat being said, I'm a huge fan of [Panic](http://panic.com/), the awesomely cool Mac software company that makes [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/), so yesterday when they launched their latest product -- [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/), an all-in-one IDE for building web sites -- I immediately took notice.\n\nTrue to form, I've already been through at least four versions of this post, each attempting to cover all my thoughts about the product, which until about ten minutes ago could be summed up as follows: \"Not as good as [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com/) or [CSSEdit](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/). Not suitable for [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) projects. Lame.\"\n\nWhat happened ten minutes ago is that I actually started trying to use Coda on a Rails project rather than just staring and getting angry at it for not being TextMate, and I started thinking that using Coda to develop for Rails may not suck as much as I thought it would.\n\nBefore I go any further, I feel I should offer a disclaimer: I am _not_ saying that Coda is necessarily well-suited to Rails development, or that the Panic dudes should be at all focused on serving my particular picky development needs.\n\nBased on an admittedly brief experience with the product, while it does appear to be a lot more versatile than you might think, Coda's killer app is definitely building simple websites (think HTML and single PHP scripts, not so much app frameworks like Rails, [Friendly](http://friendlyphp.org/) or [Django](http://djangoproject.com/)) that get served from a normal document root on a normal webserver. It's simply _amazing_ for that, and it might be the first web development product to strike a perfect balance between Ã¼bernerd code editors like BBEdit or TextMate and dumbed-down shite like [iWeb](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/) or (shudder) [Dreamweaver](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/). In particular, all you Dreamweaver users who wish Adobe would just get all the extraneous crap the hell out of your way so you can work will _love_ Coda. (Unless you're on Windows, in which case yours will be a distant, unrequited love. Just buy a damned Mac already, will ya?)\n\n\n\n## C'eci N'est Pas Une Website ##\n\n\n<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-26_coda_sites.png\" alt=\"Coda site icon\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em\" /> If there is one thing about Coda that would seem to be at odds with the Rails way of doing things, it's the site management features. Coda's workflow, like that of older-school tools like Dreamweaver, is built on the assumption that websites are \"published\" (i.e., uploaded) to a given folder on your webserver.\n\nFor a lot of web projects, that's not a bad assumption to make. In fact, Coda was able to save me a bunch of time this morning while handling a support call from one of my clients, allowing me to pull up their mostly-PHP site and make a small bug fix live on the server in about half the time my usual TextMate-Transmit setup would have required. And one of Coda's most interesting features is its ability to track changes to your project as you make them, then publish those changes (i.e., upload the changed files and nothing else) to the server with one click.\n\nI'm sure there are Rails developers out there who (at least sometimes) use (S)FTP rather than [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) to move code around. But most of my projects are deployed using Capistrano and Subversion, so maintaining a relationship between my local working copy and a remote folder isn't all that useful for me. Fortunately, unlike Dreamweaver which raises ten kinds of ruckus if you fail to provide valid local and remote site info, Coda doesn't force you to use its publishing features if you don't want to, so I'm finding that just leaving the remote root and server information blank when setting up my project in the Sites screen to be the path of least resistance.\n\nEven if you're not planning to use Coda to deploy your Rails app to the server, the Sites feature can still be extremely useful for one simple reason: Sites are how Coda keeps track of your workspace. For example, you can set up a series of tabs -- say, a web browser pointed to your local dev URL, a multi-pane Terminal tab and your routes.rb file -- and that tab/split layout will be remembered across sessions, making it quick and easy to get to work.\n\nUnfortunately, while the ability to create and maintain project-specific workspaces is super-nice, less awesome is Coda's inability to reorder tabs after they've been created. It's hardly the only app one can fault for not offering draggable tabs (neither Safari nor Panic's own Transmit have them), but it's one of those things you miss if you've grown accustomed to having it. (Of course, there's always Coda 1.1.)\n\nThat being said, people who like to push away all distractions while they're working may find Coda useful in that department. It may not be half as powerful as TextMate for writing Ruby code, or half as nice as CSSEdit for visually mucking around with stylesheets. But there's something to be said for having minimal versions of all the tools you need inside a single window you can maximize.\n\n\n## From The Wrong Side of the Tracks ##\n\nLet's just get one thing out of the way quick: TextMate users are going to find Coda irritating in a number of ways, and if you (like me) are one of those people who uses TextMate for everything from Ruby to blog posts to julienne fries, it's entirely possible that you and Coda are just not gonna make it as a couple.\n\nAt this point, hitting Cmd-T to find and open a given file within a project is muscle memory for me, and while it's not exactly hard to (for example) just pop open the `config` folder in Coda's file browser and click on `environment.rb`, it's still slower than being able to jump directly to the file I need with a few keystrokes.\n\n<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-25_coda_symbols.png\" alt=\"coda symbols\" width=\"237\" height=\"288\" style=\"float:left;margin:0 1.5em 1.5em 0\" /> When you get right down to it, what makes TextMate unique among Mac apps (but not at all unique among text editors) is its abject love and respect for the keyboard. Whereas Coda gives you a pretty iLife-like HUD for inserting \"Clips\" into a document, TextMate's \"Snippets\" are best accessed with a shortcut combo or &mdash; even better &mdash; a tab trigger. Coda's UI is far more conventional and Mac-like, which can be maddening for people who don't want to take a hand off the keyboard just to insert a bit of code.\n\nCoda does at least offer a graphical symbol browser, and in the interest of giving credit where it's due, I must say Coda's is way prettier and more intuitive than TextMate's teeny, text-only drop-down menu.\n\nBut unlike TextMate, Coda has no way of jumping to a particular symbol using the keyboard (as you can in TextMate by hitting Cmd-Shift-T). A symbol browser is fine if you have a relatively small set of succinctly-named items, like methods in a RESTful controller. But it's practically useless when you've got dozens (or hundreds) of arcane, repetitive CSS selector names, and I'm way more apt to need some form of symbol navigation there than anywhere else.\n\nAt least when it comes to the basic editing features, like completion and tab triggers, we TextMate users do have one escape hatch: Coda's editing views work just fine with the \"Edit in TextMate\" command. Of course, your code will come in as a `.coda` file, requiring you to specify a syntax grammar before you can do anything else, but that (thank god) can be done from the keyboard.\n\nOpening your code up in another app for editing may seem to defeat the purpose of using Coda at all. But as I've said, Coda's value is that it's more than just an editor, and until TextMate's project window magically sprouts a web browser, terminal and CSS builder, it's not a bad compromise.\n\nSpeaking of editing, you may already have heard somewhere that Coda's editing engine is a licensed, slightly modified version of [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/), perhaps better known as \"that crazy editor with the network sharing feature.\" That crazy Bonjour sharing was brought over to Coda, by the way, and I daresay I like the feature even more here than I did in the original.\n\nMore to the point, though, it means that Coda supports all the same language grammars SubEthaEdit does, as well as custom language grammars by way of [\"mode files.\"](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/modes.html) And if you take a peek in `~/Library/Application Support/Coda` you'll find an empty folder called `Modes` into which (I presume) you can install new modes with just a drag-drop-and-relaunch.\n\nUnfortunately, custom language grammars are just about the only hardcore hacking you're allowed to do in Coda 1.0. There's no plugin API, or even AppleScript support. What you see is pretty much what you get, so anyone whose workflow depends on being able to pop open the Bundle Editor or write a Text Factory should go back home to their regular editor, at least for day-to-day stuff.\n\n\n## Terminal Velocity ##\n\n<p style=\"width:240px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #d4d4d4;float:right;margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em\">\n\t<a href=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-26_coda_terminal_screenshot.png\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"display:block;margin-bottom:1.5em\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-25_coda_terminal.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"220\" alt=\"coda terminal\"></a>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:11px;\">OMG &mdash; multipane terminals. <a href=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-26_coda_terminal_screenshot.png\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for a full screenshot.</a></span>\n</p>\n\nIf Coda has just one killer feature that should get any Rails developer excited to at least try it, it's the built-in terminal. Coda's terminal feature is ostensibly intended to let you SSH into your webserver to restart Apache or play around with the MySQL console (both examples mentioned on the app's website). But you can, of course, just use your local command line instead. And whenever you start up a new local terminal while working in one of Coda's \"Sites\", it automatically `cd`s you into your project's working directory, so you can immediately type in `script/console` and start playing.\n\nFollowing on the \"no scripting\" theme, as far as I can tell there's no way to customize which shell commands get run right after a terminal tab is opened. So you couldn't (for example) set it up so that your app starts up on a given port when you open the project, or have it always prelaunch a console instance. So while Coda will remember your tab and split layout across sessions, you'd still have to do a little bit of typing to get your workspace fully set up before you get to hacking.\n\nAnyhow, while an automatic `cd /path/to/project` is definitely useful, it's hardly a reason to drop \$70+ for a Coda license. Nor is the ability to organize terminal sessions into tabs, something the open-source app [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.org/) gives you for free.\n\nSo where Coda's terminal integration _really_ gets interesting is its ability to open multiple terminal panes in the same tab via \"splits.\" You can create a new vertical or horizontal split in any of Coda's various modes, and you can even mix and match different modes in a single tab. If you wanted, you could have a multipane tab with your Rails app open in a browser pane and the console in a terminal pane right beneath it. Or beside it.\n\nThe only restriction is that while you can have as many splits as you want, unfortunately splits can only go in one direction (horizontal or vertical) per tab. If you've got two horizontal panes and you go to create a new vertical one, it'll let you do it, but it'll turn all of your panes vertical in the process. (I'm hoping this is a quirk or bug that'll get fixed in a future release.)\n\nObviously the possibilities are endless, but what I've been using splits for so far is to keep all my commonly used terminal stuff (usually one console instance and another that alternates between the MySQL console and a normal shell for running generators) together in one tab. They're also useful for emulating CSSEdit's \"hybrid\" view on my CSS files, with one pane showing the code and another one set to the visual style editor. Oh, and by the way: multiple panes showing the same content always update each other in real time, including web browser views pointed to local files. (Coda does have the ability to automatically refresh remote documents, but I think it only works on projects where the local pathnames and URIs match up -- i.e., static/PHP sites, not Rails apps.)\n\n\n## End Of The Line ##\n\nUltimately, I know enough to know that any recommendation I give for or against Coda is going to be meaningless to at least some of you. Some people will find that it's the web development app of their dreams, while others will spend the next few weeks flaming it for not being TextMate/BBEdit/RadRails/[your editor here].\n\nSo having taken you through the whole \"Coda on Rails\" question in exhaustive detail, I'll just say this: I bought the damned thing. At the moment I'm not actively trying to use it for Rails work -- I'm sorry, Panic, but TextMate is just _too_ perfect a tool for that job -- but I've already found myself coming back to it for stuff like editing a PHP site or a blog template, and I even used its CSS editor to do some color picking on a TextMate project earlier today. I can't say I'm using it for anything I couldn't do before Monday using TextMate, Transmit, CSSEdit or iTerm, but for certain tasks its seamless integration and one-window approach is genuinely saving me time.\n\nI've resisted the temptation in the preceding paragraphs to make a clumsy sex joke -- calling Coda my \"girl on the side\", a pretty-but-dumb little starlet I use for cheap, easy PHP action, never really planning to leave my good long-term thing with TextMate.\n\nBut I think a more apt (and way less misogynistic) comparison might be between my cell phone and my iPod nano. Both of them play music, sure, and I'd be lying if I said my cell phone wasn't a perfectly serviceable MP3 player in addition to being a pretty good cell phone. But my iPod is _the best_ music player, so I find myself using it for music even though I'd have more pocket space if I left it at home.\n\nEven if I never write a single line of Ruby code in Coda, I'm still finding it useful for other things. As an editor it's just serviceable (at least in comparison to the iPod of coding environments), but it's a pretty good IDE, with an excellent CSS editor and crazy good workspace features. I'm finding it valuable, even if it's just once or twice a day when I need to do one of the things that it's good at.\n\nAnd really, what more could you want from a product?"

    title: "Elegie for ImageReady"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " I&#8217;m pleased and surprised to report, dear readers and fellow nerds, that the video support in Photoshop CS3 Extended is quite simply the shizzle-nit. ImageReady fans and Photoshop CS3 beta users will already be quite familiar with the Animation..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-19_imageready_elegy.png\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px\" />\n\nI'm pleased and surprised to report, dear readers and fellow nerds, that the video support in [Photoshop CS3 Extended](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshopextended/) is quite simply the shizzle-nit.\n\nImageReady fans and Photoshop CS3 beta users will already be quite familiar with the Animation palette's \"frame\" mode (which may or may not be available in Photoshop Standard). Extended (which comes with the \"Premium\" CS3 bundles, and is also available as a standalone product) adds an After Effects-like timeline interface and the ability to use video clips as Photoshop layers, which can be manipulated with Photoshop filters. (I'm still figuring out how to apply a filter/adjustment to more than one frame at a time.) For hardcore motion graphics artists, it's no substitute for After Effects, Motion and their ilk, but it's fine for simple compositing or the occasional animated GIF.\n\nUnfortunately, the animation palette is all that remains of poor [ImageReady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ImageReady), the red-headed stepchild of the Creative Suite family. There is no ImageReady CS3: after nine years, Photoshop's Web-centric sister app has been discontinued.\n\nImageReady was originally released way back in 1998 as a standalone product, apparently intended as a simple tool to make Web graphics for people who didn't want to mess with the added complexity (and price tag) of Photoshop. It failed to attract many sales, so from 1999 onward it was bundled with Photoshop, and over time more and more of ImageReady's feature set was ported over to the mothership, most notably its Web optimization tools which exist now only as the \"Save for Web and Devices\" dialog.\n\nBut optimization wasn't ImageReady's only trick. It also did image slicing way better than the equivalent feature in Photoshop, and until the arrival of Photoshop CS3's new Animation feature it was the best tool for designing and exporting GIF animations. (I will point out, before I get too deep into my post-ImageReady pity party, that Photoshop CS3's frame animation tools are identical to those included in ImageReady CS2, and the new timeline interface in Photoshop Extended is a vast improvement on the old ImageReady UI for more complex videos and animations.)\n\nI suppose that now that Photoshop can handle animation on its own, there's no compelling reason to keep ImageReady around, and it's certainly more convenient to be able to create an animated status spinner without having to launch a second memory-sucking app just to handle that one simple task.\n\nBut ImageReady's slicing interface was always _way_ better than Photoshop's. While I try to avoid using tables for structure in my web pages these days, I've often found it useful to use slices when creating sets of similar images, like a set of icons or textual navs that needed a rollover. In ImageReady I would go ahead and create my rollover states, use the now-extinct Slices palette to quickly establish a logical naming scheme for the files, then export the images without the code. The best thing about this approach was that all of my rollover states and metadata could be saved in the PSD file, so I could come back and re-create one or all of my rollovers later on if I needed to.\n\nPhotoshop does have slicing, yes, as does Fireworks. But I don't care for Fireworks's inspector-heavy interface (just as I don't like dealing with Flash if I don't have to), and doing something as simple as renaming a slice in Photoshop requires a right-click and some quality time with a modal dialog. As for multiple image states (i.e., rollovers), forget it. The powers that be at Adobe have apparently decided we simply don't need them in Photoshop anymore, maybe not even considering that people might have been using that feature for something other than making a chintzy JavaScript nav bar.\n\nNow, I will allow that Photoshop CS3 does bring some much-needed improvements to the Web graphics party. For one thing, the Save For Web dialog now includes the option to automatically shift your artwork from its native color space to sRGB on export and (as far as I know) ships with that option turned on by default, which should be helpful (if not a panacea) to anyone who's ever built a website on a Mac only to get a client call asking why the colors look totally oversaturated and nasty on Windows. And it is certainly nicer to create animations directly in Photoshop rather than to launch a second memory-guzzling app just to make a status spinner.\n\nThough while I may be in the minority here, I certainly would have preferred to wait another six months while Adobe's developers found a better way to merge ImageReady's feature set into Photoshop and Fireworks before they discontinued it. As it stands, it's like they've thrown the baby out with the bathwater, having first cut off its head in case we need its brain for anything. ImageReady was created as a Photoshop spinoff and maintained for years as a subordinate app to the big feathery monster. Clearly Adobe didn't realize that in the process of making \"Photoshop for the Web,\" they might have accidentally built a product that was nominally useful in its own right.\n\n\n## And Speaking of CS3 ##\n\n![cs3 dock icons](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-04-19_cs3_dock_icons.png)\n\nOn Tuesday, after paying my annual tribute to his federal majesty Joe Government, I decided to continue the whole \"cost of doing business\" theme and ordered Creative Suite 3 Web Premium from Adobe's website. Specifically, I ordered a Creative Suite 3 Web Premium (CS3WP) _upgrade_ from Photoshop CS2, which saved me 200 whole dollars off the cost of just buying the whole thing from scratch. Gee, _thanks_ Adobe.\n\nUnless you're a print designer who honestly only ever uses Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, you'll probably end up buying one of the \"Premium\"-level CS3 bundles when/if you choose to upgrade, so let me give you some advice: unless you actually use Fireworks or you just can't bear to part with an extra hundred bucks, get Design Premium. The Design Premium (DP) and Web Premium (WP) bundles are exactly the same, except that Design Premium omits Fireworks and Contribute in favor of InDesign, which I would say is a better, more useful app than the other two put together and injected with plutonium.\n\nThe Web Premium bundle is definitely more Web-centric, but seriously -- who the hell actually uses Contribute? I recognize and respect that some designers, especially Windows-using ones, find Fireworks to be a valuable tool for making pixel graphics with vectors. But Contribute is one of those apps that's of little practical value to any one designer. Its whole purpose is to allow non-designers to update websites designed in Dreamweaver without screwing things up, which means that while the webmaster may need to use it for testing or administrative purposes, it's just not something you need outside of a larger organization.\n\nI guess what I mean to say is: _one_ Contribute license, activated on the same machine that's used by the person designing and building the website in Dreamweaver, sounds pretty damned useless. I would think that the kinds of places that need Contribute are the kinds of places that need it _a lot_, that need multiple licenses or a site license so the folks in Marketing can upload a press release without bugging the designers or IT guys. Now, if you could activate the actual \"pro\" apps on one machine and Contribute on another, then you've got something.\n\nAll that being said, both \"Premium\" bundles are a great value in the same way that an \$85 tasting menu is a great value compared to a \$45 entree.\n\nWeb Premium retails for \$1,599, with upgrades from a previous Creative Suite bundle priced at \$499 or from Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver or Flash priced at \$1,399. These prices are steep until you consider that the individual apps bought separately would cost you \$3,593. The only way you're getting out the door cheaper than this is if you have individual licenses for recent versions of the apps you need, as Adobe's upgrade prices tend to be at least somewhat reasonable. I, unfortunately, have been using academic versions of Illustrator and Flash since 2004, and the cost of a Photoshop upgrade plus retail copies of those two products would have been \$100 more expensive than just buying the damned bundle, which (from my perspective, at least) netted me Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Acrobat Pro \"for free\".\n\nAnyway, some thoughts:\n\nThere's not much to say about Photoshop CS3 that I didn't either say above or in [my post about the public beta release](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/12/photoshop_cs3_first_impression). I will take this opportunity to reiterate a couple of things from that post:\n\n1. It's still _awesome_ that Adobe offers digital delivery for all their products, including CS3 Web Premium. It's not so much that I absolutely _needed_ the thing right away, but I like being able to save a few trees when I can.\n\n2. That idiotic Flash-powered online store of theirs is still the most annoying, overbuilt piece of crap I've seen on the Web in a long, long time. It breaks the Back button, and really, is there anything that site does that couldn't have been done as well or better with some well-placed Ajax? Apple's e-commerce site has all kinds of smartness these days, and they didn't feel the need to replace their perfectly usable web pages with some kinda QuickTime movie. And that wacky Java applet \"download manager?\" What the fuck, Adobe?\n\nI just opened up the shipping version of Photoshop to make some of the graphics for this post, and found that it's starting up and performing noticeably faster than the beta did, and Illustrator CS3 is _way_ faster than CS2 running under Rosetta. The real test, of course, will be seeing whether leaving Photoshop open for an hour or more still leaves my computer a slow, aching hulk of aluminum-coated pain, begging me for a reboot.\n\nThat new CS3 toolbar theme -- with the translucent gray \"docks\" containing collapsible palettes and toolbars -- is super-nice. Unfortunately, the super-niceness extends only to Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash. And while Flash CS3 shares the new common UI, a lot of its interface still smacks of its Macromedia heritage. Granted, I can't say I know what Flash would be like without a property inspector, but I'm wishing they'd given it a shot. That said, the new, more Illustrator-like drawing tools in Flash more than make up for any other nitpicks. (Also, the ability to dock the Actions palette along the top or bottom edge of the screen is seriously hot.)\n\nI wish I could say anything as complimentary about Dreamweaver: its UI has hardly changed at all since the last release, which means that (at least on the Mac) it remains buggy, clunky and overly complicated, with the same stacks of inspectors I've been trying to avoid looking at since the MX era. (Seriously, they didn't even do away with the hideous Aqua striping they've been rocking. The Dreamweaver and Fireworks UI themes are _exactly the same_ in CS3 as they were in the last release.) The only obvious, significant change: the \"Layers\" inspector has been renamed \"AP Elements\" (i.e., Absolutely Positioned). I can't say this is any clearer than the old nomenclature, but at least it's accurate, and it eliminates the temptation to expect CSS \"layers\" to behave anything like Photoshop, Illustrator or Flash layers.\n\nI do appreciate Acrobat Pro not automatically associating itself with every PDF document on my computer. I _hate_ when it does that."

    title: "Why Markdown (or Textile) Rocks"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Because WYSIWYG HTML editors are crap, especially when you're building web sites that will end up being maintained by people who don't know HTML."
    body: "MarsEdit developer Daniel Jalkut took the opportunity to pimp his product's excellent support for [John Gruber's](http://daringfireball.net/) [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text formatting syntax, and in doing so came up with [a far simpler, most elegant explanation](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/324/marsedit-markdown) for why I try never to include WYSIWYG HTML editing in the web apps I build for my clients:\n\n> I see Markdown as a response to a major problem with WYSIWYG HTML editors: they overpromise and under-deliver, almost guaranteeing disappointment. If you can get your content to look the way you want it to, youâ€™ll probably be horrified to see the HTML code that has been computer-generated to make it happen. Markdown strikes a nice compromise by providing a predictable set of rules so that you know exactly what youâ€™re going to get.\n\nI think people like WYSIWYG editors for the familiarity: they're supposed to behave like Microsoft Word, and people expect that they'll work just as well and that the output will be just as reliable. The problem, of course, is that most WYSIWYG editing widgets on web pages (and even in desktop apps, I'm sorry to say) generate total crap HTML and can't easily be customized to reflect the styling of any one particular website, so the styled text you end up with never quite looks the way you expect.\n\nMy solution is simply to insist that clients use Markdown or [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile) and offer them some training not only on how to use the formatting syntax, but how it fits into _their_ website. For a new client project launching early next month, I'm actually going to put together a style guide telling them what combination of Textile codes and CSS classes they need to use to achieve a consistent look throughout the site.\n\nJalkut brings up another great benefit to using an HTML filter like Markdown. On most Markdown-aware blogging apps (like the Movable Type system that powers this blog), the original Markdown-formatted source text is what gets stored in the database, and it's converted to HTML when the post or page is saved. For Rails stuff I've even built a little plugin called `acts_as_cached_html`, which automatically generates and saves an HTML version to a separate field whenever the original record is saved for quicker access later on.\n\nWhy is it important to save the body text as something other than HTML? Well, let's say you want to redesign your site at any point in the future. You'll always have to work around the code generated by a WYSIWYG HTML editor, which may include CSS styles or non-semantic tags that could conflict with whatever changes you're trying to make. (These problems would come up in your initial design as well, but this argument assumes that when you originally designed the site you didn't have however many existing posts forever trapped in bad markup.)\n\nGranted, you don't have any control over the HTML generated by Markdown either, but that HTML is minimal and agreeably semantic -- unless you're doing something really beyond the pale, you're probably always going to want to encase your paragraphs in `p` tags and your headers in `h1-h6` tags and so on. Markdown does just enough of the right thing, not way too much of the wrong thing. And as Jalkut points out, the output is dependable. Markdown only supports a small-but-useful subset of HTML, and once you're familiar with Markdown you pretty much know everything it's ever going to do. Reliability is a much-valued quality when you're building a web app that's going to be used by non-programmers who aren't gonna be able to tell you that the page is messed up because an `address` or `center` tag showed up in the wrong place.\n\nNot to mention the fact that plain text styled with Markdown is just plain _prettier_. Gruber patterned the Markdown syntax on formatting conceits familiar to anyone who got into e-mail before the era of rich formatting and \"Stationery\". By the way, if you ever want to see an example of what I'm talking about when I complain about WYSIWYG editors making bad code, try building a web page in Pages or viewing the raw source of an e-mail message sent from Apple Mail, and compare it with some code from a blog like Daring Fireball (or dare I say this one). Even if you don't build web pages, the difference should be obvious.\n\nWhat's more, Markdown doesn't rely on JavaScript or browser plugins to do its thing. Markdown runs on the server as part of your web app, so it's just as useful to someone running a text-only browser like Lynx as to someone running IE7 with a dozen toolbars and security turned off. This is especially important to someone in my line of work, who doesn't want to end up providing tech support when someone sits down at a strange computer in a strange office and finds that their WYSIWYG editor is mysteriously broken.\n\nSo, children, let's recap. Markdown is good because:\n\n* It provides reliable, semantically accurate HTML output.\n* It doesn't rely on browser features that may have been disabled for security reasons.\n* It's simple and easy to learn, and non-technical users can be trained not only on how to use it, but how using Markdown fits into _their_ website.\n* The text is readable and looks good whether it's been converted to HTML or not.\n\nIt's good stuff. If you build web applications for money, you owe it to yourself to check it out if you haven't yet. You can find several different implementations just by checking around Google. The ones I use most frequently are [PHP Markdown](http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) for (you guessed it) PHP, and [BlueCloth](http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth) for Ruby."

Lo and behold, today I see [this post from pundit Nicholas Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/apple_intros_13.php), the gist and tone of which you can more or less get from the headline: \"Apple intros \$13,000 PC.\"\n\nHe writes:\n\n> Apple today introduced an eight-core version of its Mac Pro computer, the top model of which, tricked out with 16 gigs of RAM and four 750-gig hard drives, will cost you more than thirteen grand.

What are commodities?\" \n\nWhat Carr is trying to say here is that PCs are supposed to be cheap nowadays, and this 8-core behemoth is not cheap, and the conclusion left to be drawn by the reader is that Apple is at it again, charging way too much for something that rightly should cost a buck ninety-eight at the local computer mart.\n\nLet us look, shall we, at what you get for your \$13,000:\n\n* **Dual 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon \"Clovertown\" processors.** Not only are these quad-core processors -- the equivalent of four individual 3.0 GHz chips packed onto a single piece of silicon -- and not only are there two of them (for a total of _eight_ processor cores), but Intel isn't even officially _selling_ the \"Clovertown\" chip yet. Intel is giving Apple early access to the chip, and right now the 8-core Mac Pro is the only shipping product in the world that has it. This will likely only be true for another short while, but still -- this is a computer on the bleeding edge. Your typical \"commodity\" Dell PC probably has either a single-core Pentium processor or a dual-core Core or Core 2, not eight cores of Xeon power. And by the by, Apple does offer a \"commodity\" PC. It's called the Mac mini, it sells for about \$600, and even that PC has a dual-core chip.\n\n* **16 GB of 667 MHz DDR2 RAM,** or to translate the acronym soup, _sixteen gigabytes of physical memory._ My MacBook Pro is pretty swift and capable with just 1.5 GB of memory, and will only ever hold up to 2 GB. Entry-level PCs these days come with 512 MB to 1 GB of memory, tops. These days 1 GB of memory is kinda minimal, 1.5-2.0 GB is solid. 16 GB is, for most users, ridiculously excessive, and accordingly expensive. Only a tiny subset of people will ever *need* that much memory, and these people already expect to pay through the nose for it.\n\n* Before I tell you about the next bit, let me pose a rhetorical question: how much storage do you _need_? I have a single 100 GB hard drive on my Mac, which I supplement with a couple of backup drives totalling 660 GB. My G5 iMac, which these days exists only to feed my Apple TV, has a 250 GB drive that I've only managed to halfway fill in 18 months. And if by some chance all of that were not enough, I've also got a 30 GB iPod, a couple of 1 GB iPod shuffles and about 6 GB of SD card storage I use with my digital camera. Altogether, that's 1.2 TB of storage space without even getting into DVD-Rs, CD-Rs or online storage options.\n\n    Know how much of that I'm using? Realistically, probably less than 30%. If I needed to, I could make do with just the 100 GB on my laptop, which is less than 15% of my total storage capacity.\n\n    That \$13,000 Mac Pro comes with **four 750 GB hard drives,** all of which are faster and more durable than the one in my MacBook Pro, which is no slouch in terms of speed or hardiness. That's _three terabytes_ of built-in storage. Granted, if I were editing HD video or mastering DVDs I'd use that up shockingly fast. But the \"commodity\" user isn't doing those things, or at least not doing them so much, so often, that they need to be able to store the equivalent of 630,000 MP3s on their computer at all times.\n\n* The top-end Mac Pro also comes with an **Nvidia Quadro FX4500 graphics card with 512 MB video memory and two dual-link DVI ports.** So not only can it work with some very, very complex graphics, it can output them onto _two_ 30-inch Cinema Displays. At once.\n\n* You also get **two (not one, two) 16x dual-layer SuperDrive DVD burners.**\n\n* Of course that configuration includes both 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0. _Of course_ you do. And gigabit Ethernet comes standard on all Mac Pro models. But you also get **a quad-channel 4Gb Fibre Channel card.** That's massively fast networking. How fast? Well, a top-speed Fibre Channel connection runs at 4 gigabits per second, which is faster than _the internet_. Fibre Channel is used for connecting workstation-class PCs and servers together at speeds comparable to the short-path connections inside a computer, for such things as grid computing or massive storage farms. This is in addition to 400 Mbps wireless and 1 Gbps Ethernet. This is the very definition of something the average user doesn't need.\n\nIt's simply not sufficient to point out that the \$13,000 Mac Pro is a pro machine. My laptop, which cost me about \$2200 out the door, is a pro machine. The quad-core Mac Pro is something else -- it's a monster. It's a workstation. It's a freaking supercomputer.\n\nIt is _not_ a \"commodity.\""

    title: "Oscars Game: It's Over!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Well, that was a blast. The 2007 Oscars Game is officially over, and was officially the biggest, bestest one yet. We had 214 registrants, of whom about 180 actually entered picks, which is at least double last year&#8217;s turnout. Thanks..."
    body: "Well, _that_ was a blast. The 2007 Oscars Game is officially over, and was officially the biggest, bestest one yet. We had 214 registrants, of whom about 180 actually entered picks, which is at least double last year's turnout. Thanks to everyone for playing.\n\nNow, onto the results:\n\n* We had a two-way tie for first place, between **piersevent** and **arango** with 450 points each. Based on tiebreaker responses, I awarded an extra point to **piersevent**, making him the winner of the 2007 Oscars Game. He received a \$50 iTunes Card and the people's ovation and fame forever. As runner-up, **arango** will recieve a \$25 iTunes Card and some enthusiastic back-slapping.\n\n* There was a three-way tie between **rimarfish**, **Aliciaz** and -- OMG! -- myself for fifth place (see below for some explanation of Oscars Game rankings). So to determine our third place finisher I once again went to the tiebreakers, and awarded an extra point to **rimarfish** making him/her the third-place finisher, pending e-mail confirmation. Note to rimarfish: I need you to [e-mail me](mailto:ddemaree@gmail.com) to claim your prize in the next couple of days, or else you'll forfeit your extra point and Aliciaz will be named the third place finisher.\n\n\n### Scoring and Rankings ###\n\nAs for the rest of you, it's been brought to my attention that some explanation of the new ranking system may be in order. In previous years, the scoring system was (as I've said) rather byzantine, which was intended to reward especially skillful predictions while reducing the likelihood of the kinds of 10-way and (yes) 35-way ties we had last night. The old scoring system was great at eliminating bunching in the rankings, but always took at least a day to program and a week to explain. So for 2007, I switched to a simpler format: 24 categories, 25 points each, with winners determined by a tiebreaker round. (Incidentally, if none of our top finishers had filled out the tiebreaker questions, the winner would have been whoever signed up first.)\n\nMost Oscar categories are not hard to predict, and a certain amount of bunching is inevitable. So when -- not if -- I ended up with ten people all with the fifth-highest point total, what do I call that? Is that a 10-way tie for fifth place?\n\nAnyone who scored 350 in last night's game knows that it is not. The rankings are based on the number of players who scored equally well or better than you did. If you scored 350, there were 10 players who did just as well as you did and 25 players who did better. Therefore, the ten of you who scored 350 are considered to be in a 10-way tie for 35th place, as you would have had to outpick 34 other people to win.\n\nJust to give you an idea of where the tiers are, here's how everything stood before the tiebreaker round:\n\n* There was no one in first place, and a two-way tie for second place, at 450 points.\n* Three people tied for 5th place at 425 points.\n* Eight people tied for 13th place at 400 points.\n* Twelve people tied for 25th place at 375 points.\n\nFor the tiebreaker round, I started from the top group and worked downward. Since there were just two people at the 450-point level, I awarded one extra point (to piersevent) and declared arango the runner-up by default. If there'd been three or more people in that group, the third-place finisher would also have come from that group. So the final rankings are basically in this order:\n\n* Final game score\n* Tiebreaker score\n* Registration date, with earlier registrations taking precedence\n\nThe tiebreaker questions asked players to predict which film would win the most Oscars, and how many it would win. Anyone who picked _The Departed_ got the first one right, and from there it came down to whose prediction of how many Oscars it would win was closest to the real number (which, by the way, was four). If a player failed to answer the question, they forfeited the tiebreaker round. If all players answered the question and got it wrong -- e.g., everyone picked _Dreamgirls_ or _Little Miss Sunshine_ -- then I'd go with the player who picked the movie that won the most Oscars out of the ones selected by that group. In other words, in the land of the blind, the man who picked _Pan's Labyrinth_ over _Babel_ is king.\n\n\n### Servers and Code ###\n\nOn the one hand, you could say that any server setup I could have chosen for the game would have been better than the shared hosting box at TextDrive that served it up last year. In 2006, the game crashed at least seven times during the telecast, requiring me to spend most of my Oscar party restarting it and apologizing to users.\n\nThis year the Oscars Game was moved to a speedy VPS server at [Blue Box](http://blueboxgrid.com/), and the performance was fantastic. At peak I'd say the game was handling 20+ live Ajax updates per second, which was pretty phenomenal. There were some Apache hiccups (that were my own dumb fault) that made the game pages inaccessible for some users for the first hour of the telecast, but once I got those issues resolved everything was hunky dory.\n\nAnd just to recap for the folks who don't already know: yes, the Oscars Game was built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), served up via [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/) and Apache. The game application was designed and developed by yours truly, and as soon as I've got some time I will be (a) reconfiguring it into a \"demo mode\" so people can play around with it over the course of the year and (b) looking into opening the game source code so all you Rubyists and Rails-heads out there can check it out.\n\n\n### Winners and Nominees ###\n\nOf course, being a cruel bastard, I would make you read through a few paragraphs of nerdery about the game mechanics and the code it was written in before I would tell you a damned thing about what I thought of the Oscars themselves. I shall torment you no longer:\n\n* I still think _Children of Men_ was the best film of last year -- not just because I enjoyed it, but because it was genuinely inventive on a number of levels. That it didn't win the Oscar for Emmanuel Lubezki's amazing camerawork (losing Best Cinematography to _Pan's Labyrinth_, which was prettier but entirely conventional) was a crime against cinema.\n\n* I haven't yet seen _The Lives of Others_, so I can't say with any certainty whether it was any better than _Pan's Labyrinth_, which was assumed to be a lock for Best Foreign Film going into last night. But _Lives of Others_ is certainly the better-reviewed film (both by the _New York Times_ and friends of mine who've seen it), so my gut feeling is that the Academy partially redeemed itself here, choosing the superior work of cinema over hip eye candy. (Not that there's anything wrong with hip eye candy, but that's what we have the Art Direction and Makeup awards for.)\n\t\n* For some people, especially here in Chicago, the memorable moment last night belonged to Jennifer Hudson, a South Side native who, as you may know, was booted from _American Idol_ only to land a breakthrough role in _Dreamgirls_ for which she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.\n\n\tYeah, I suppose that was a nice moment, if you're into that sort of thing. That \"sort of thing\" being, yaknow, women breaking into tears on national television. I'm certainly not opposed to that, and it's way more charming and affecting coming from Jennifer Hudson than it is from, say, Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\t\n\tBut for me, the big Oscar moment was when Al Gore (announcing, with Leonardo DiCaprio, that this year's Oscars had gone green) started to read his Very Important Announcement, only to get cut off by the 'get off the stage' music. Hilarious.\n\t\n* Speaking of Al Gore: does anyone else find it bizarre that we now live in a world where Melissa Etheridge has an Oscar?\n\n* Here's a short, not-complete list of Scorsese movies I like better than _The Departed_: Definitely _Taxi Driver_, _The Last Temptation of Christ_ and _GoodFellas_. Depending on my mood, I might even add _The Age of Innocence_ (with its hot, circa-mid-90s Winona Ryder action) and _The Aviator_ (with its balls-out crazy Brechtian artificiality) to that list.\n\n\tThat being said, I do quite like _The Departed_. And if the members of the Academy aren't inclined to agree with me that _Children of Men_ was the best movie of 2006, we can at least agree that _The Departed_ was a better pick for Best Picture than the other four nominees.\n\n* Some folks liked Ellen DeGeneres's performance as host. Personally, I thought she was far from the worst host in recent memory (that would be a toss-up between David Letterman and Whoopi Goldberg), and I think I have to admit that she did a better job of it than Jon Stewart did last year. There's a reason why Stewart didn't make it as a traditional late-night talk show host, and why his interviews are (in my opinion) the weakest part of the _Daily Show_: he sucks at banter. And hosting the Oscars (or the Emmys, or the Grammys, or the Chicagoland Area Tractor Sales Association Awards) is all about banter.\n\n\tEllen was certainly annoying to my young, hip, edgy sensibilities, but no more or less so than Billy Crystal, so she's probably got a long future ahead as the person the Academy calls to host the show after everyone else turns them down.\n\t\n\tThat said, I miss Chris Rock. Now _there_ was an Oscar hosting job for the 21st century."

    title: "Damned Lies Redux"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "One of my favorite episodes of The West Wing is the one where Josh is stalking around the White House, complaining about a poll that says that 51% of Americans disapprove of foreign aid spending by the federal government and..."
    body: "One of my favorite episodes of _The West Wing_ is the one where Josh is stalking around the White House, complaining about a poll that says that 51% of Americans disapprove of foreign aid spending by the federal government and 50% think it should be cut, the punchline being that 1% of the people surveyed in this particular poll don't support foreign aid spending but _don't_ think it should be cut.\n\nI think about this episode whenever I see some ridiculous numbers being used to draw a specious conclusion. And so I thought about it today when I saw that according to a study by market research firm Compete (as [reported by _PC World_](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129329-c,cellphones/article.html)), \"consumers\" are not willing to pay \$500 for an iPhone.\n\n> Compete surveyed 379 people in the U.S., most of whom had heard of the iPhone and have shopped for an iPod, to find out how interested they are in the device to produce the uncommissioned report.\n\n> Among the 26 percent of respondents who said they're likely to buy an iPhone, only 1 percent said they'd pay \$500 for it. When Apple introduced the iPhone in January, it said it would cost \$500 on the low end.\n\n> Forty-two percent of those who said they're likely to buy the phone said they'd pay \$200 to \$299.\n\n> The iPhone will be available only to subscribers of Cingular Wireless, now part of AT&T. In a blow to the operator's competitors, 60 percent of those in the survey who said they were likely to buy the phone said they'd switch their mobile operator in order to get it.\n\nBefore I dive into my rant here, let me be clear: I haven't read the study itself, and I won't discount the possibility that the researchers' findings were substantive and conclusive. Rather, I'm reacting to the way the data has been expressed by IDG reporter Nancy Gohring, who apparently thinks saying that someone can be called \"likely to buy an iPhone\" and \"unwilling to buy an iPhone for \$500\" at the same time.\n\nCompete apparently found that of all the people they surveyed (a sample group that had high iPod and iPhone awareness), 26% said they were \"likely to buy an iPhone.\" That word \"likely\" can mean a few different things, and the article is mum as to whether these people consider themselves \"likely to buy an iPhone _in June_,\" when it will sell for no less than \$500, or \"likely to buy an iPhone _at some point_\" after the prices come down. \n\nIf it's the former, then Apple will probably do well. If it's the latter, then the iPhone may not really take off in the marketplace until Apple releases a lower-end model. The article simply doesn't say, instead just leaving the reader armed with enough useless data to make their opinion feel suspiciously like fact. If a person reading this news item is predisposed against the iPhone, then that data point will read like this: \"26% of people would love to buy an iPhone, but think Apple is crazy to be charging so damned much.\" Conversely, an Apple fanatic will see that stat and think that 26% of all consumers are going to buy an iPhone on day one.\n\nThese are two mutually exclusive conclusions that could easily be drawn from the way this data is presented in this article. It's useless to look at whether a group of people considers themselves \"likely\" to do something without also knowing how much they care about it. Is it \"sorta likely?\" \"Very likely?\" \"Relatively likely,\" in the sense that 74% of people want to throw every iPhone on the planet into a big bonfire and 26% don't?\n\nThe article also states that \"among\" that 26% slice of the survey group, \"only 1%\" were willing to pay \$500. Well, okay, but which 1% are we talking about? Is it 1% of the overall group, or 1% of 26%, which would be 0.26%? I'm pretty sure that Gohring means \"1% of 26%\", which (considering that the whole sample was just 379 people) would imply that _only one person in 379_ said they would absolutely pay \$500 for an iPhone.\n\nNow, tell me, which of these statements is clearer:\n\n* \"Among the 26 percent of respondents who said they're likely to buy an iPhone, only 1 percent said they'd pay \$500 for it.\"\n\n* \"Of all the respondents, only 0.26% said they'd pay \$500 for an iPhone.\"\n\n* \"Only one person out of the 379 surveyed said they would pay \$500 for an iPhone.\"\n\nIt's not simply a matter of trying to avoid an unbiased, pejorative statement -- all three of those statements are (one would hope) supported by the survey data, and they all say the exact same thing. If anything, the phrasing Gohring _did_ use reflects a bias in that she's gone to great syntactic lengths in order to use the phrase \"only 1%\".\n\nI'm not saying she's an Apple-hating zealot, necessarily. Look at it this way: in the whole story, she managed not to use the _truly_ scary data point for Apple, which is that 74% of consumers were not \"likely\" to buy an iPhone. And it's entirely likely that she wasn't trying to find words that make the iPhone look good or bad, but rather that she incorporated more statistics into that sentence, perhaps in an effort to make her story look more authoritative than it really is.\n\nAt any rate, this way of expressing sample groups as overlapping data sets drives me _crazy_, because \"another 1%,\" \"1% among 26%\" and \"1%\" can all mean different things. And using such imprecise, colloquial ways to describe statistical data, while not always malicious, encourages some very lazy, facile thinking. Such as the belief that you're being well informed by reading _PC World_ magazine, because they said only 1% of 26% of 379 respondents in a survey conducted by nameless, faceless experts were willing to pay \$500 for a device they've never used, held or even seen in person.\n\nWhile I _am_ one of those zealous Apple fans you read about (whose Apple TV -- a device I've never used, held or even seen in person -- is on order), I haven't fully made up my mind one way or the other about buying an iPhone. I've got a cell phone and iPod I like, and I'm not sure whether it's worth switching cell phone carriers after three years with T-Mobile just to get the latest hotness.\n\nI just have to wonder: would those people in the survey have felt better about the price if it were expressed the way the statistics were in this _PC World_ article?\n\n\"Would you pay 50% of 1% of ten million pennies for an iPhone?\""

    title: "Oscars Game: Fabulous Prizes Announced!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "And if it gets any more complicated than that, we'll just cross that bridge when we come to it."
    body: "It's only about three days until Oscar Night, and until now I've been pointedly mum about what the fabulous prize is for winning the [Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/). There are two reasons for this:\n\n1. I'm lazy and indecisive.\n\n2. As an experiment, I wanted to try seeing how much interest there would be in playing the game and using my fun, beautiful little web app on its own merits, even if the prize turned out to be a pair of socks.\n\nOf course, what kind of lame dork would I be if the prize were socks? I mean, what on earth do socks have to do with movies?\n\nAnd so it is that I announce the prizes for the fifth annual Practicalmadness Oscars Game:\n\n* **Grand Prize:** \$50 iTunes Card (and the people's ovation and fame forever)\n* **First Prize:** \$25 iTunes Card (and ovation and fame till next week)\n* **Second Prize:** \$10 iTunes Card (and a firm handshake)\n\nThere are, of course, a few conditions and caveats: these specific prizes are for the U.S. iTunes Store. Non-U.S. residents will receive a similar prize of equal value, to be chosen and announced if and when it comes up.\n\nWinners also _must_ provide a valid e-mail address. I am aware that the \"re-send confirmation e-mail\" button on the game has not heretofore, ah, worked. This has now been fixed, and while I do realize that not everyone chooses to spend their whole weekend glued to a computer, confirming your e-mail address takes less than five minutes. Hell, less than two, if you're speedy.\n\nJust log into the Oscars Game and click on \"Edit My Profile\". If you see a giant orange box telling you you haven't confirmed yet, then you haven't. Click the link inside of that box to have your confirmation e-mail re-sent.\n\nI assure you: unless you checked the opt-in box when you signed up, you won't be deluged with spam. I never sell users' personal information, 'cause that's just not how I roll. Your e-mail address will _only_ be used to communicate with you about the Oscars Game, and will be used as sparingly as possible.\n\n\n### How To Win Fabulous Prizes ###\n\nJust to recap how the Oscars Game works:\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, players have visited the website to make their predictions. Each player can make one pick per category, and every correct pick is worth 25 points. The player with the highest point total at the end of the night wins the game.\n\nOf course, there is a sticky situation that has yet to be addressed: what if there is a tie?\n\nHonestly, it's never come up. However, this year's scoring system is a lot simpler than previous years' have been, and there are certainly more players. So it's not inconcievable that there could be a tie.\n\nI have therefore adopted the following tiebreaker rules:\n\n1. I've added two tiebreaker challenge questions to the 'Edit my profile' screen. The questions are simple: which movie will win the most Oscars, and how many will it win.\n\n2. In the event that we have a tie and neither player has had a chance to answer the tiebreaker questions, the winner will be whoever signed up first.\n\nAnd if it gets any more complicated than that, we'll just cross that bridge when we come to it.\n\nIf you haven't visited the Oscars Game website in a while, please come on back and make sure your e-mail address is confirmed, and take a second to answer the tiebreaker questions. Cause, yaknow, there could be something in it for you.\n\nThanks, everyone, for playing!"

    title: "Criminally Negligent"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "A substitute teacher risks being sent to prison because Microsoft thought opening up some ports and networking APIs would make computing \"easier\" and \"more fun.\""
    body: "The _New York Times_ has [the story of a substitute teacher in Norwich, CT, Julie Amero](timesstory) who is facing up to 40 years in prison for \"multiple counts of risking injury to a child.\" So did she ask children to climb a power pole? Did she set deadly, venomous snakes loose in the room as a learning exercise?\n\nNo, she was surfing the internet from a classroom computer that didn't have spyware- or popup-blocking software, and came back from the restroom to find her charges huddled around a screen covered in ads for porn sites. She tried to physically block the screen and shooed the children away, but claims she is such a technophobe that she didn't know how to yank the power cord or turn off the monitor.\n\nThis was back in 2004, when \"spyware\" and \"pop-up ads\" were just entering the mainstream lexicon, and it's totally reasonable (I think, anyway) to believe that she just didn't know how to deal with a bad case of Windows Gone Wild. Besides, she says she was always trained not to mess with any of the equipment in the classroom.\n\nThis is appalling. She may have deserved to lose her job; surfing the internet in the classroom during the school day isn't very cool, even if she couldn't have predicted she'd be the victim of a porn overload. But there's a very, very wide range of consequences between an administrative punishment (like suspending or firing her) and sending her to jail.\n\nThe _Times_ does mention that she was offered a plea bargain that would have allowed her to avoid a prison sentence, but even if any other punishments (like fines, restraining orders, et al.) were minimal, there's a case to be made here that that if there was any criminally negligent behavior here, it wasn't on the part of Ms. Amero.\n\nI'm hesitant to say that the notoriously lax system security in the first release of Windows XP absolves the user of responsibility for what happens on their computers. But one of the saddest effects of the Windows spyware epidemic that Microsoft took five years to fully address is that it became virtually impossible for non-technical users to fully manage or control an internet-connected Windows machine.\n\nThis was a public school district, not a Fortune 500 company. The first update to XP to seriously address its vulnerability to malware was [Service Pack 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP#Service_Pack_2), which was released in August of 2004. The incident that may send Julie Amero to prison occurred in October of that year. In any large organization with a fully funded and capable IT staff, it can take weeks or months to deploy a major operating system upgrade under the best circumstances, and public schools tend to have more than their share of equipment and support problems that would divert IT staff away from simple maintenance, like installing OS updates. The _Times_ mentions that during Ms. Amero's trial, the IT manager for the Norwich school district testified that pop-up blocking software was installed but was several weeks out of date.\n\nAs much energy I've spent -- as a volunteer IT monkey at home, school or work, as a computer salesguy and now as a consultant -- explaining to folks that computers are neither magical nor sentient, they are very complex tools, and there are times -- more numerous in 2004 than today, to be sure -- when you simply cannot hold the end user responsible for their behavior to such a dire extent.\n\nIn large organizations, a computer is never so much owned as shared by all the people who use it: the people who manage and care for it, the people who bought it and, yes, the people who made it. The IT staff for the Norwich schools never checked the computer for spyware, and evidence and testimony by a computer consultant who believes that it was \"out of control\" was ruled inadmissable on a technicality. And absent the simple, technological explanation, a jury would be left with no choice but to lay blame on the teacher.\n\nBut if we accept the defense's premise that the computer was infected by spyware, and the prosecution's belief that exposing children to the end product of such infection was a criminal act, couldn't it be argued that to charge Ms. Amero with a crime is like accusing a person who discovers and reports a ticking time bomb of being a terrorist?\n\nAnd if we can't go after the people who made or planted the bomb -- the malware and spyware authors -- shouldn't we make some effort to punish the people whose lax approach to security allowed the bomb to be planted to begin with?\n\nJust something to think about next time you're walking past the Windows Vista display at Best Buy. It took Microsoft five years to find a remotely effective solution to Windows XP's security issues, and they're charging money for it. Meanwhile, a substitute teacher risks being sent to prison because Microsoft thought opening up some ports and networking APIs would make computing \"easier\" and \"more fun.\"\n\n[timesstory]:http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/nyregion/14teacher.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1"

    title: "Microsoft Used To Be Smarter"

    body: "Being a Mac partisan, I imagine that when I say nasty things about Windows it's easy to assume that my basis for argument is simple preference: Mac good, therefore Windows bad (or at least less good). And I can further imagine that when I recommend that people dump their PCs in favor of an iMac or MacBook, my recommendation has less to do with the relative merits of your Dell versus my Apple than with a blind faith in the superiority of my chosen platform (not to mention a little bit of brainwashing from old Steve Jobs).\n\nWell, last month -- as Microsoft was beginning to hype Windows Vista's Jan. 30 retail launch -- [Dave Winer noted something on his blog](winerpost) that I think a lot of us have overlooked in the last few years:\n\n> Used to be when Microsoft wanted to take a market from a successful competitor, they started by seducing their users with something comfortable, a product that worked just like the competitor's, and was better in some major way.\n\n> ...When IE came on the market, it worked keystroke for keystroke the same as Netscape. You could switch in a couple of hours. And it was faster, prettier, just nicer in every way. Even though it was the dreaded monopoly slaying the smart but arrogant upstart, IE had enough for users that you actually felt good about using it. Finally someone cared about users. Netscape, which had forgotten about the browser, obviously didn't.\n\nToday the Windows-IE monopoly has been in place for so long that it's easy to forget this, but there was a time when using Microsoft products was something one did by choice, not because they're an entrenched standard.\n\nBack in the mid-90's Microsoft's competition in the office software market was weak, to be sure, but there were many people -- my family included -- who could and would and did use Lotus or WordPerfect/Quattro Pro, even if they did sometimes have freaky compatibility issues with Word and each other. Our first Windows 3.1 machine ran WordPerfect for Windows, and as we upgraded machines and operating systems we would also upgrade WordPerfect, even after Office 97 arrived on the scene and finally secured Microsoft's stranglehold on the market. My late mother's last PC (a bargain-basement Dell which has been sitting quietly by my desk for two years) came with a copy of Corel WordPerfect on it, and she never bothered to install Microsoft Office, and that's how she went into the 21st century without ever having learned MS Word.\n\nI, on the other hand, was eventually seduced over to Word and Office. I got used to the ways that Word 97 was different from Novell WordPerfect 7, and eventually grew to love Word's simpler UI and fast performance. It wasn't just that Office was the standard; my mom, remember, soldiered on with WordPerfect for seven years after it stopped being a viable product. I found that I genuinely preferred Word because it did everything WordPerfect did, only with greater speed and elegance.\n\nOf course, that was then and this is now. Microsoft Office has been dominant for so long that its only real competition on Windows are, well, older versions of Office, just as the biggest threat to the success of Windows Vista will be people deciding they're fine with XP and don't need to upgrade.\n\nI switched to the Mac in 2002, having never upgraded from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP. Why? For more or less the same reason many people are holding off on upgrading to Vista: because I would have had to buy a new computer. My PC at the time was a Dell laptop running a 400 MHz Celeron, with enough memory that Windows 2000 performed like a champ. Under the hood, there aren't that many differences between 2000 and XP -- if anything, 2000 was superior to XP Home (and maybe even XP Pro) because Microsoft hadn't yet exposed the ports and system API hooks that made it so easy to infect and cripple PC with malware.\n\nAnd yet, XP required a 600 MHz processor and more hard drive space than I could free up, even though Windows 2000 was installed and running perfectly. Even now, I have no idea why XP needed that extra 200 MHz of horsepower. Some constantly-running background process to make sure I wasn't counterfeiting money? Was it checking and re-checking my activation key to make sure I really hadn't pirated it?\n\nI couldn't really say there was any compelling reason to upgrade anyway, apart from the fear that if I didn't my computer would become obsolete. But now they were telling me my computer -- which, by the way, is still running and usable for basic web and e-mail stuff -- already _was_ obsolete. My value-crazed mother always refused to let me get a Mac on the basis that Windows machines were more upgradeable, like an old car that can keep driving ten years past its warranty with a little luck and a good mechanic. And that was true for a while, kind of.\n\nThe arrival of Windows XP was the end of that era, and now upgrading to a new Windows release just feels like a household chore. You do your dishes because otherwise you can't eat; you upgrade Windows because otherwise you won't be able to run the latest apps, and no other reason.\n\n[winerpost]:http://www.scripting.com/2007/01/09.html#microsoftUsedToBeSmarter"

    body: "Well, it doesn't look like I'm going to have time to finish building my Rails-based blogging app for this site anytime soon, so I spent a few <del>minutes</del> <ins>hours</ins> today working out the bugs that have made posting or updating templates an experiment in terror, then working on a new home page template.\n\n[You can see the new, still-in-beta homepage here.](/index_beta.html)\n\nOne thing I definitely wanted to do in the next iteration of the site was to go back to having all the content -- both longer blog posts and shorter Recommended links -- in one column, in chronological order.\n\nThe problem here is that creaky old Movable Type doesn't allow one to mix content from more than one blog on the same page without some major hacking, which is one of many reasons why I still plan to jettison MT as soon as I have some spare time to build something better. Right now I've cobbled together a stopgap solution that uses the MT-SQL plugin to grab my fifteen most recent entries from both blogs, and to display slightly different HTML depending on whether a given post is long-form or short-form.\n\nDesignwise, I'm getting really tired of the ultra-narrow content column on the home page, while starting to see some flaws in the super-wide 960-pixel layout I did for the [Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/). So I've settled on an 800-pixel layout, with about 540 pixels set aside for content and 120 set aside for...something. I dunno what yet. I moved the short bio/intro for myself to the top of the page, so I'm not yet sure what will live in that sidebar.\n\nUnfortunately, my preferred way of doing the archives in the new design -- paginated archive sections combining posts from both blogs -- is simply not possible in Movable Type, so I may just not bother to put anything over in the sidebar until I've had a chance to switch to the new software. And in the meantime, my readers can enjoy a homepage that's actually somewhat readable.\n\n\n### An Extra Treat for All Your RSS-heads ###\n\nStarting today, I have merged the weblog and Recommended Links RSS feeds. If you're subscribed to the [main site feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Practicalmadness), you'll start seeing Recommended Links content (in addition to the same great blog post action) as soon as FeedBurner updates itself later today. The Recommended Links feed will still be around, but there will no longer be a separate feed just for weblog entries, at least until I can get migrated away from Movable Type."

    title: "Fun With Amazon SQS and Rails"

    body: "This morning I'm working on a little client project that involves passing messages between a [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) app and a dead-simple worker process using [Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS)](http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Queue-Service-home-page/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2/104-5100684-9379146?ie=UTF8&node=13584001&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA).\n\nBefore last week I'd certainly heard of SQS, but I'd never had occasion to use it. In a nutshell, SQS is a web service for passing short messages between processes or applications, for instances where it's not possible or practical to have one app on one machine do all of the work.\n\nFor example, this particular Ruby app has to transcode some audio files after they've been uploaded. Ignoring any other issues of storage or scalability for the moment, it's simply not a great idea to have the Rails app do this work directly (as in, to have your model or controller class do the transcoding as part of its normal HTTP request-serving business) just because it takes too long. While a given Rails/Mongrel dispatcher is tied up overseeing the audio conversion stuff, there could be dozens, hundreds or even thousands of simpler web requests it could be handling.\n\nImagine, if you will, your local Starbucks. Let's say that there's one green-apron behind the counter, serving an endless stream of customers. For the most part, these customers are just walking up to the counter, asking for a black coffee to go, getting it and walking away. For purposes of our metaphor, let's say that these customers are just normal page requests, just web browsers looking at your app's home page. And one barista -- one Rails dispatcher -- is able to handle these simple requests quickly and easily.\n\nBut when one person in that endless stream of customers, being served by just one coffee jerk, asks for a Frappuccino, all hell breaks loose. The barista has to leave the counter, walk over to the Frappuccino-making station, get out the pitcher, fill it with ice and various globs of sugary nonsense, blend it, cup it, top it, lid it, walk it back and charge you money for it. This is a very time-consuming process, compared to just pouring a coffee, and in our metaphorical Starbucks we only have one person to do all of this work.\n\nSo while the person at the front of the line is sitting there waiting for their Frappuccino, all of the customers behind him are just left standing there. From their perspective, the store may as well be closed for that five minutes. These are your users, trying to visit your website and seeing a blank white page because somebody needed to upload a file.\n\nThis, in short, is why there are always at least two people working the counter at Starbucks -- one at the register to handle simple requests like a cup of coffee, and one at the bar to take on the slower, more resource-intensive work.\n\nWhat SQS does in this scenario is simple: it passes messages from the frontend web application to the swarm of worker bees that will be doing the hard labor, much like our Starbucks cashier who jots some inscrutable code onto a paper cup and hands it to the person at the bar who'll be making the drink.\n\n"
    extended: "\n## We'll See Who Gets More Honey ##\n\nOf course, my use case for SQS -- the worker-bee process that collects SQS messages and performs tasks -- is something I've never had to write before, so I decided to write a little example app just to make sure I could get this kind of thing to work on a smaller scale before asking it to, you know, transcode big audio files.\n\nSo I built a background process that does a few things:\n\n* Connects to SQS and gets a queue URL. If it can't get a queue URL, it just stops.\n\n* But if it _can_ get a queue URL, it loops infinitely and checks for new messages.\n\n* If it gets a new message, it inserts it into a MySQL database using Active Record, as a new `Bee` object, then deletes the message. This database insert is standing in for whatever _meaningful_ work this worker process might need to do, like transcoding audio or video, backing up some data to an offsite server, sending a bajillion e-mails, etc.\n\n\tI created the `bees` table and database insert just as a way of verifying that messages posted to my queue would be picked up and acted upon by the looper. After I started up the looper, I would go into `irb`, set up an SQS connection and send a message, then switch back over to MySQL to see if a new row had been added to my table.\n\n* The `bees` table has a boolean field called 'seen'. New messages inserted from SQS are always marked as seen, because the looper has a second job: to automatically append \"...FOR ME TO POOP ON!\" to the text content of any 'bees' that aren't marked as 'seen'. Start up the `looper` script as a background process and just try adding a new row to the 'bees' table that doesn't have `seen` set to 1 -- it will be pooped on.\n\n\tThis I did as a first, non-SQSified experiment in having a background script work with my database. (Also because I was bored.) Amazingly, having a Ruby script hit the database asking for the first available unseen Bee a few hundred times per second didn't affect database performance, even on my dumb old laptop with Photoshop, iTunes and a number of other notorious resource hogs running. That I'm pleasantly surprised by this should tell you how little experience I have with down-and-dirty server stuff.\n\nYou can [grab my sample code here (ZIP file, 4 KB)](http://disk.practical.cc/bingo/public/blog_stuff/sqs_example_with_bees.zip). It includes the `amazon_sqs` library for talking to SQS, a short and sweet `Bee` class for use with Active Record, and of course the Ruby looper. I also tossed in a SQL file with the `CREATE TABLE` statement for our `bees` table. The `looper` file contains the database configuration, which assumes that it'll be using a database called `worker_bees` on a local MySQL server, but you can season to taste.\n\nBefore you can really work with this stuff, you'll need Ruby (of course), RubyGems and Rails. Actually, for this code you don't need _all_ of Rails, just Active Record and Active Support. But hey -- Rails is awesome, and you should get into it. If you don't already have Rails on your Mac or *nix box, [Dan Benjamin has a heck of a good tutorial](http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx) that should sort you out. (And not that this helps anyone right now, but the next major Mac OS X release -- [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/), rumored to be coming out in a month or two -- will include Ruby on Rails as part of its standard Developer Tools package.)\n\nIf you don't already know how to launch the looper as a background process, just make sure it has the correct permissions (I just used `chmod 777 looper` because I'm lazy) and enter `./looper > /dev/null &` on your *nix or Mac OS X command line. The looper _shouldn't_ be printing anything to the terminal, so that `> /dev/null` bit may be unnecessary. But what the hell, it's harmless, as far as I know.\n\n\n## Going One Step Further ##\n\nThe great thing about this kind of looping script is that it's _just plain Ruby_. That means it can do anything Ruby can do, and that includes working with a Rails app environment.\n\nIf all you need your worker bee to do is access the same database as your app, then it may be sufficient just to use Active Record, as I've done in my example code. However, if you're going to be using more than one model, or will need access to any other part of the framework (like, say, ActionMailer), it may make sense to just load in your Rails environment before starting the loop.\n\nTo do that, you'll want to load in the `config/boot.rb` file for your Rails app. But before you do that, you may need to set a couple of constants telling Rails a few things about your script.\n\nBy default, Rails's bootstrapper (which is loaded and run by `boot.rb`) assumes that your file is located in a subdirectory of the Rails app, e.g., that our looper is located at `path/to/your_app/script/looper`. It then sets the `RAILS_ROOT` constant to `path/to/your_app/script/../`, or `path/to/your_app`. So if your looper is in `script/looper`, this should work:\n\n<code><pre>\n\t# This is taken straight from script/runner\n\trequire File.dirname(\\_\\_FILE\\_\\_) + '/../config/boot'\n</pre></code>\n\nBut if your looper script is _not_ living in the same spot as your Rails app, you'll want to set the `RAILS_ROOT` constant _before_ loading in `boot.rb` so the bootstrapper knows where to look for things. For example:\n\n<code><pre>\n\t# This should work\n\tRAILS\\_ROOT = \"/Users/ddemaree/Rails/clients/thisproject\"\n\trequire \"#{RAILS\\_ROOT}/config/boot\"\n</pre></code>\n<code><pre>\n\t# This will make Rails angry\n\trequire \"#{RAILS\\_ROOT}/config/boot\"\n\tRAILS\\_ROOT = \"/Users/ddemaree/Rails/clients/thisproject\"\n</pre></code>\n\nAnd if you don't want Rails to load in the default \"development\" environment, you'll want to set the `RAILS_ENV` constant.\n\n<code><pre>\n\t# Now we're cookin'\n\tRAILS\\_ENV  = \"production\"\n\tRAILS\\_ROOT = \"/Users/ddemaree/Rails/clients/thisproject\"\n\trequire \"#{RAILS\\_ROOT}/config/boot\"\n</pre></code>\n\nYou could also just change/set an environment variable on your machine (e.g., `export RAILS_ENV=production`), if you want ALL instances of this Rails app to use the same environment. This may be a good idea on your server, since then you won't need to worry about different scripts needing to be individually configured to use a given environment. But on your development box, you'll probably either want to leave the defaults alone (since it'll assume that you want the \"development\" environment, which is probably right) or stick with the \"development\" environment.\n\nOnce you've loaded in `config/boot.rb`, you'll have access to your entire Rails environment, just like in the console. Your script will establish a connection to your database (using the settings in `config/database.yml`), load in any plugins you have installed, and add the appropriate folders to your load path.\n\nWhich means this following sketchy, untested bit of code _should_ work:\n\n<code><pre>\n\t# I say this works because this is how Rails's script/* commands do it\n\tRAILS\\_ENV  = \"production\"\n\tRAILS\\_ROOT = \"/Users/ddemaree/Rails/clients/thisproject\"\n\trequire \"#{RAILS\\_ROOT}/config/boot\"\n\twhile true\n\t\t# Let's just say you've got a model called NiceThing, which is\n\t\t# oddly similar to the Bee model from my example code\n\t\tif thing = NiceThing.find(:first, :conditions => \"seen != 1\")\n\t\t\tthing.update\\_attributes(:text => thing.text + \"...FOR ME TO POOP ON!\", :seen => true)\n\t\tend\n\tend\n</pre></code>\n\nSo let's say we launch this in background, and it works. Next we'd go into the Rails app's console and play around:\n\n<code><pre>\n\t~/Rails/clients/thisproject:\$ script/console production\n\tLoading production environment...\n\t\\>\\> NiceThing.create(:text => \"A beautiful wide-brimmed hat\")\n\t=\\> &lt;#NiceThing ...&gt;\n</pre></code>\n\nAnd then we wait about a second or two, and then we ask for that record again.\n\n<code><pre>\n\t\\>\\> NiceThing.find(:first).text\n\t=\\> \"A beautiful wide-brimmed hat...FOR ME TO POOP ON!\"\n</pre></code>\n\nAnd that's how you set Triumph the Insult Comic Dog loose in your Rails app."

    title: "Oscars Game: Pants Your Mom Too"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "So far, the 2007 Oscars Game is off to a great start. My sincerest to everyone who signed up yesterday and today, who had to put up with some first day hiccups. Like, oh I dunno, the Pools feature not..."
    body: "So far, the [2007 Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) is off to a great start. My sincerest to everyone who signed up yesterday and today, who had to put up with some first day hiccups. Like, oh I dunno, the Pools feature not being ready until late last afternoon. I think I've squashed most of the bugs at this point, and it's looking pretty solid.\n\nI wrote about [the new widget hotness](http://practicalmadness.com/2007/02/oscars_game_widgety_goodness) in my last post, and I'm hoping to collect some data in the next day or so that'll tell me whether anyone but me has opted to publish their Oscars Game picks on their website.\n\nThe other, more interesting new feature this year is Pools, which is my first feeble attempt at adding some more sociableness to the game. In the current release, a Pool is essentially a group scoreboard. Any player can create a pool and invite their friends via e-mail to come join them, and the pool members get a \"scores and stats\" page that's specific to that group.\n\nRight now, pool members can see what percentage of them picked a particular movie, and on Oscar Night they'll have the same real-time updating as the main \"Oscar Night Live\" page. So a bunch of people having an Oscar party could all sign up for the Oscars Game and set up a pool, then set up a laptop tuned to their pool's web page on the game website during the Oscarcast, adding a whole new dimension to their couch surfing.\n\n<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-02-07_pantsyourmom.png\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em;float:right\" />Meanwhile, I spent about half an hour today adding some features in response to this one dickwad who thought it would be funny to sign up for the game with an obscene screen name and e-mail address.\n\nOn the one hand, I could have added some kind of IP banning or account deletion code that would allow me to kick cancerous little cretins like this out of my digital kingdom forever.\n\nBut that would have been less fun than what I _did_ do. Which was:\n\n* I totally redid my layout HTML and CSS so I could add [a big, red banner](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-02-07_check_out_banner_michael.png) to the top of the page that would be visible to this one user, and only this user, gently reminding them that (a) they're being a dick and (b) you have to have a valid e-mail address to receive a prize, should you win one. (Not surprisingly, this person's confirmation e-mail bounced.)\n\n* I redid the code that displays the links to players' names on the scoreboard and pool pages so that certain unprintable words would be replaced with certain other _nonsense_ words, thus denying the twit the pleasure of seeing \"f**kyourmom\" appear on a couple dozen other computer screens.\n\n\tInstead of seeing \"f**kyourmom\" and being offended, they will see \"pantsyourmom\" or \"bunniesyourmom\" and be confused.\n\t\n\tAnd the code uses a random phrase generator, so the nonsense word that replaces the obscenity is different each time you refresh the page. I'm almost prepared to _encourage_ folks to sign up with obscene screen names, so as to turn the scoreboard into an amazingly random work of Dadaist art.\n\t\n\n## The Numbers ##\n\nI always build in a few hidden features, and mostly they're for my own use in administering the website and spying on my users. Sometimes I password-protect them, and sometimes I just leave them open so I can send links to my friends so they ooh and ahh over my brilliance.\n\nMy favorite hidden feature, making a return appearance from last year, is [the Global Stats screen](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/picks;stats), which aggregates all of the pick data from the game to give a glimpse at the collective prediction powers of my users.\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n\t<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-02-07_og_global_stats.png\" />\n</p>\n\nAnd so far, the collective Oscars Game user base has made the following predictions:\n\n* There seems to be little doubt that Scorsese will win Best Director, Forest \"Idi Amin\" Whitaker will win Best Actor, Helen Mirren will win Best Actress, and Jennifer Hudson will win Best Supporting Actress. Perhaps that's because these people have already won these awards at _every other awards-giving thingamabob this season._\n\n* In the Oscars Game as in Hollywood, there is dissent as to which movie should win Best Picture. _The Departed_ seems to have the slight edge, but _Babel_ and _Little Miss Sunshine_ are right on its ass, and none of the three have more than 42% of the vote. I expect the Best Picture numbers to fluctuate right up to the last minute. (My own pick right now is, in fact, _The Departed_, but I'm still collating data on how well it's done with the various craft unions and producers' groups before I make my final call.)\n\n* Same story with Supporting Actor: Eddie Murphy (_Dreamgirls_) and Alan Arkin (_Little Miss Sunshine_) are neck and neck, and I think they've already swapped spots a couple of times in the last 36 hours. Mark Wahlberg is in it too, though I would expect (and it looks like the Oscars Game players agree with me) that his rapping, underwear-modeling past will come to haunt and deprive him of an Oscar. (See also Brad Pitt's nomination for _12 Monkeys_ in 1996.)\n\n* There are a _lot_ of _Pan's Labyrinth_ fans playing right now -- it's favored to win Art Direction, Makeup and Foreign Language Film, and it's in the mix for Original Score and Cinematography too. The only category where the film (which is in Spanish) is totally out of the running: Original Screenplay. (I still need to see it.)\n\n* Amazingly, there are people who _don't_ think _An Inconvenient Truth_ will win Documentary Feature. _Iraq in Fragments_ has a solid 16% of the picks, and _Jesus Camp_ has 5%. So _AIT_ is still very strongly favored, but there's more dissent than I would have expected. I'm curious to know, folks -- have you seen these movies, or are you making picks based on other data? Maybe there's some upset potential here that I haven't considered.\n\n* What's the the suspense-filled horse race of the season (other than Best Picture)? Surprisingly, it's Animated Feature -- _Happy Feet_ and _Cars_ are neck and neck. The stupid penguin movie currently has the edge over the stupid car movie, and I myself am pretty sure _Happy Feet_ is going to take this one. What I can't decide is whether _Cars_'s strong showing is because people loved the film or because people are assuming that a Pixar movie will always win any Oscar it's up for.\n\n* And we clearly all hate Randy Newman: his nominated song from _Cars_ has zero picks. What's less clear is which of the three songs from _Dreamgirls_ will take home the Oscar. It's _possible_ that they'll split the vote, resulting in an upset win for \"I Need To Wake Up,\" the Melissa Etheridge song that plays over the end credits/infomercial of _An Inconvenient Truth_. And at that moment, my friends -- the moment when Melissa Etheridge has an Oscar -- the world will implode."

    body: "This year I've made the annual [Practicalmadness Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) a lot simpler: instead of offering multiple picks and byzantine scoring bonuses, it's just a straight pick 'em game, with the winner being the person who correctly predicts the most categories. Of course, by simplifying the game (and not having to write and test a kabillion different scoring cases), that's freed me up to add in some cool little grace notes I otherwise would have had to skip.\n\nYou know, like widgets.\n\nIf you're reading this on the homepage this week, you'll note that there's now a new section in the right-hand sidebar titled \"David Nemesis's Picks\". This, ladies and germs, is the official Oscars Game blog widget, which is a short snippet of JavaScript that retrieves my picks from the game server and displays them in attractive, standards-based XHTML. It even includes an stylesheet for extra black-and-gray action, though (as you can see) it is also possible to disable the stylesheet so you can tailor the look and feel of the widget to your liking.\n\nAnd as I demonstrate in [this video](http://disk.practical.cc/bingo/public/Oscars-Game-Widget-Demo.mov), the picks as displayed on your web page update whenever you update them on the game website, so if you put the widget on your blog and then decide two weeks from now that you must have been on crack when you picked \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" for Best Picture, you won't need to do anything to make your own website reflect the change.\n\nWas there a huge groundswell of public demand, crying out, \"widgets! Widgets! Widgets!!!\" No, there was not, but I've always wanted to write one, so here it is.\n\nNow, the Oscars Game is not _officially_ open for business yet, though I've started letting some people past the proverbial velvet rope early while I work out some final kinks in the system. If all goes according to plan, the game will be ready for its adoring public on **Tuesday, February 6**. If you'd like me to e-mail you when registration opens up, just go to [the Oscars Game homepage](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) and fill out the form therein."

    title: "I Heart Bank of America, Part 275"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I tell anyone who&#8217;ll listen that, at least for tech fans, Bank of America is the shit: their online banking is the best I&#8217;ve ever used, and they are seemingly the only bank willing to invest energy into making banking..."
    body: "I tell anyone who'll listen that, at least for tech fans, [Bank of America](bofa) is the shit: their online banking is the best I've ever used, and they are seemingly the only bank willing to invest energy into making banking more user-friendly. They earned another big chunk of admiration from me yesterday when I went to my local branch for the first time after my big European sojourn and discovered that they had replaced all their ATMs with brand-new models. And that these models have a really wonderful, innovative new feature.\n\nAt most banks, making a deposit at the ATM requires stuffing your bills or checks into an envelope and feeding it into a slot in the machine, after telling the ATM how much money is in the envelope. This has always been more than convenient enough for me. However, BofA decided to kick it up a notch by giving their ATMs the ability to not only accept cash and checks directly -- that is to say, allowing you to feed your check directly into the machine rather than stuffing it into a special envelope.\n\nFor example: you want to deposit a check for \$2500. On these new ATMs, after you've entered your PIN and selected \"Deposit\" from the main screen, you just endorse the check and feed it into the machine. The software then shows you an image of your check and asks you to confirm that the amount (as scanned from the amount box using handwriting recognition) is correct. If it's not, I assume you're asked to provide the correct amount. If it is, you're done -- there is no step three. You can then feed it additional checks or banknotes, and when you're finished, the printed receipt includes a tiny version of the check(s) you just deposited for your records.\n\nIt's the handwriting recognition that really makes this beautiful. The ability to feed money directly into the machine is nice, but it's not vital, and for people who routinely deposit multiple checks it's actually _harder_ to use. But by scanning the check for the amount, they've eliminated a step, as well as the need to remember the exact number so you can type it into the keypad. (This is especially helpful to me, since I'm a freelancer and am rarely depositing the same amount twice.)\n\nThey've also extended the cut-off time for deposits to be considered received on the same business day, to 8 PM local time (from the more typical 4 PM). It's possible that there's some dark side to this -- that to pay for the lost revenue from the interest on deposits held an extra day because they came in at 5:01, they're raising overdrafts and other fees to a million dollars, or something.\n\nBut it definitely corresponds better to what I'd assume is most BofA customers' typical use case for ATM deposits. Most people probably stop by after work, which would put them there after lobby hours and definitely after the 4 PM deadline for same-day acceptance. And most people, I would assume, just need to deposit a single check at a time, and want to do so as quickly and simply as possible in order to get home and eat, see their families, watch porn, whatever.\n\nMaking an ATM deposit is one of those little things: it was already pretty convenient, compared to using a drop box or finding the time to go into the branch during business hours so you can wait in line for a teller. And what BofA has done here isn't revolutionary -- it's an incremental improvement, but one that will make using an ATM genuinely more convenient and user-friendly.\n\nI lump it into the same category as their voice-activated phone banking (which seems to work way, way better than other phonebots which can barely tell a spoken \"one\" from \"seven\"), which always says \"please\" and \"thanks\", and which offers \"talk to an associate\" as a main menu option. Some of the other banks I've done business with -- Citibank, I'm looking at you -- are clearly only interested in improving their technology to increase profits by forcing customers to shift their banking activities to ATM machines, phone systems and web sites that are underpowered and poorly designed. It's like the design document for these tools spent no time talking about the features and benefits for the end user, and lots of time discussing how they'd save Citibank money compared to hiring decent staff.\n\nNot being a total moron, I don't doubt that Bank of America wants their customers to use ATMs so that they too can make their operations more efficient and profitable. And I don't disbelieve any of the negative things other folks have told me about them. But I think it says a lot about a company when they offer their customers tools that are genuinely useful to the customer, and not just convenient for the provider.\n\n[bofa]:http://www.bankofamerica.com/"

    title: "Oscar Time"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " The Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday morning (while I was in a plane over the Atlantic, natch), and some of you may already be wondering: where the crap is the Oscars Game? Weeelll, I&#8217;m especially indifferent about the Oscar..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2007-01-24_oscars_game.png\" alt=\"Oscars Game logo\" width=\"260\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" />\n\nThe Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday morning (while I was in a plane over the Atlantic, natch), and some of you may already be wondering: **where the crap is the Oscars Game?**\n\n_Weeelll_, I'm especially indifferent about the Oscar nominations this year (why wasn't \"Children of Men\" nominated for Best Picture, _Academy?_), and I _do_ have an awful lot of work on my desk.\n\nHowever, I've done an Oscars Game app every year since 2002, and it would be a shame to break a tradition that involves something I could write, test and deploy over a weekend, that I enjoy writing. At the same time, I think that over the last couple of years the Oscars Game has gotten a little too big for its britches (even though it's never been larger than about 50 players).\n\nSo here's the deal: I have decided that there _will_ be an Oscars Game this year, and I'm going back to basics: one pick per category, no bonuses, no special categories that are worth extra points. There are 24 categories and each one is worth 25 points, for a total of 600. If you correctly pick an especially tricky category, like Live Action Short, your reward will be that you get 25 points and other people do not. If you correctly pick all of the top categories, then you can just give yourself a pat on the back and accept my sincere compliments on your Oscars-picking skillz.\n\nAs for prizes, I'm going to keep those mysterious for now. My thinking right now is that there will be just one prize, for the winner, and I may add additional prizes if a lot of people sign up. If I get really ambitious, I may even add some features that allow you to invite your friends (to see how you stack up) -- more players means it's more likely that I'll splurge on more awesome prizes. (Oh, and if I've ever stiffed you on a prize before, please keep reading -- there's a note for you below.)\n\nI've posted [a signup form for the 2007 Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/), and anyone who's interested in playing can just leave their e-mail address to be notified when the game is ready. Additionally, Oscars fans in the Chicago area can also indicate whether they'd be interested in attending this year's Practicalmadness Oscar Night. I'll have the Oscarcast on my HDTV, a flat panel set up with the live Oscars Game scoreboard, and also some beer. Lots and lots of beer.\n\n\n## In Which I Am A Jerk ##\n\nFor various reasons, I might have forgotten to send prizes to some Oscars Game winners in the past. I do sincerely apologize for this, and I will gladly make it up to you. If you've won an Oscars Game prize in a previous year (or this one, for that matter) and never received it, please [send me an e-mail](mailto:david@practicalmadness.net?subject=Where is my Oscars Game prize, you jerk?) with your name, the e-mail address you used to sign up for the game (you should have received some kind of confirmation e-mail when you signed up) and, if you remember, the prize you were promised.\n\nUnfortunately, I will not necessarily be able to offer you the same prize -- henceforth I will only be offering virtual prizes (i.e., stuff that can be e-mailed, like gift certificates or software licenses). If yours was a physical prize, like (oh I dunno) a 512 MB iPod shuffle, then you will most likely receive an equivalent online prize, like a \$79 gift certificate to the online Apple Store good for the purchase of a newer, shinier 1 GB Shuffle.\n\nAnd once again, my sincere apologies for stiffing you."

    title: "Through The Looking Glass"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I&#8217;m back from spending a week in Paris, and life on the other side of the pond was interesting to say the least. For starters, while navigating Parisian streets can be perilous for someone used to Chicago&#8217;s super-rational grid system..."
    body: "I'm back from spending a week in Paris, and life on the other side of the pond was interesting to say the least. For starters, while navigating Parisian streets can be perilous for someone used to Chicago's super-rational grid system -- I got lost at least four times, and started keeping my handy City Moleskine with 25 pages of maps in my jacket pocket at all times -- I'm now totally in love with the Metro (and networked transit systems in general) as compared to the dirty, hard-to-use CTA. The Metro quite simply goes everywhere, even if you do have to change three times to travel a relatively short distance, whereas the CTA trains (which are based on a hub model, with all train lines converging in the Loop) are most useful within a very, _very_ narrow portion of the city.\n\nIn other words: I was able to get from the Louvre to Montmartre in less than half an hour with less than a quarter-mile of walking. To get from my apartment in Bucktown to anywhere in Lincoln Park using only trains would require me to take the Blue Line into downtown, then switch to a Red or Brown Line train to come all the way back up here, then walk half a mile. Yes, there are buses, but in Paris (and I think also in NYC or London, which have networked train systems) I wouldn't need the buses or half as much walking. Of course, part of what makes the Metro such a robust train system is that there's simply more of it, and it's virtually impossible to go anywhere without at least two connections between the 14 (yes, 14) subway lines.\n\nAnd it's not like I didn't know this going in, but it's really impressive to see the symbiosis between public and private transport in Europe. They quite simply value public transit more over there, a fact made obvious when you see that _every single_ Metro train and station is cleaner, brighter and safer than _any_ space or vehicle maintained by the CTA. And yet, there are still plenty of cars (and trucks, buses, bicycles, motorcycles and scooters) on the streets.\n\nI don't have to wonder whether getting around in American cities would be easier and more pleasant if we'd just put more money and care into public transit -- I know that to be the case -- but any citizen or politician who doesn't believe we need to spend more money making sure the Blue Line doesn't randomly catch fire in the middle of rush hour could stand to spend a day or two riding the Metro in Paris. I don't think the CTA could ever be as good, but surely it can't be that hard to make it better than it is.\n\nEven beyond the cleanliness and stellar urban planning, there are some really notable things about the Metro system's usability:\n\n**The signage is uniformly simple, readable and easy to understand, even for people who don't speak French.** And they update the system/line maps on their trains regularly, such that station closings are denoted _on the current maps_, unlike here in Chicago where they end up posting dozens of signs and making announcements to ensure that people know that (for example) half the Brown Line stations and the transfer tunnel at Washington Street are closed for a long, long time. Chicagoans, remember when the CTA screwed up some maps last summer and had to use stickers to cover up the mistake, because they couldn't afford to reprint all those maps? Je sigh.\n\n**Not only are their ticket vending machines more modern and usable, they still have human ticket agents.** Here in Chi-town, if you need anything besides a Chicago Card recharge or a single-use Transit Card, you either need to go to a third-party sales agent (like a Currency Exchange) or use one of the high-volume tourist stations (like Chicago/State on the Red Line) where they've put in special vending machines for day passes. In any case, the only time you're face-to-face with a CTA employee is if something is wrong, either because something is broken or because you're in trouble. In Paris, the only Metro employees I ever saw were ticket sales agents -- they actually _want_ to be face-to-face with their customers, and it's possible to buy a book of 10 passes or whatever else you need at just about any station.\n\n\n## I Pee Freely ##\n\nI once got into a stupid argument with one of may all-time least favorite professors about the necessity of public toilets in the U.S. I was working at a big Starbucks on Michigan Avenue at the time, and part of my job was cleaning up after people who came in just to use our public restroom as a toilet, shower, makeup mirror or opium den. And I took the very American viewpoint that since there were _some_ toilets that were public, then that was a solved problem and Deborah doth protest too much.\n\nWell, I can't say I'm now an enthusiastic fan of public toilets, but having been in a magical world where you can't go more than four blocks without seeing one, and really having had to pee just as I found one, and not having had to find a McDonalds or Starbucks instead, was quite a good experience.\n\nIn the U.S., public toilets (or any bathrooms in public places, like metro stations or parks) have a frankly deserved reputation for being (to put it politely) poorly maintained and unsafe. And since Americans believe it's their god-given right to not have to pay someone to take a shit, pay toilets have never really found traction in our cities. (French public toilets, by the way, are funky little self-cleaning kiosks which until late last year cost a euro or two to use. They are now all 100% free of charge.)\n\nOne of the single weirdest aspects of my stay in Paris was that I didn't have to provide a credit card or even my home address to check into my cute little family-owned hotel -- I just gave them my name and moved in, and settled up when I left. It felt weird because the American way, the corporate way, of doing business is to always try to secure the transaction as much as possible up front, under the cynical assumption that the other person in the deal will try to take advantage of you and therefore must be constrained in their ability to do so.\n\nThe Hotel Sunny way of doing business, conversely, is to assume that people will honor their agreements until they demonstrate otherwise. I'm sure one reason why local governments are unwilling to try public toilets in their cities is the fear (probably justified) that homeless people will move into them and use them for shelter, or that drug addicts will use them to shoot up, or whatever other dark things free people will do when given something to use freely. I think the Hotel Sunny school of urban planning, if there were one, would be to say: so what? _Of course_ people are going to find (shall we say) off-label uses for public toilets, in just the same way that the same syringe that a diabetic uses to take insulin can also be used to shoot heroin. But viewed in the aggregate, the benefits to a society of being able to pee freely have got to outweigh the potential negatives.\n\n\n## You'll Shoot Your Eye Out ##\n\nMoving beyond pay toilets for a moment, let me tell you something you may not know about Paris: they ride bicycles and motorcycles on the sidewalks. Well, not on the same paths used for walking -- several of those famously wide, gorgeous Parisian boulevards have separate paths for vehicles, which are not limited to just bicycles and Segways as they are in Chicago. Vehicles that are smaller than a car but bigger than a bicycle seem to be recognized as their own class of transport, which can be driven and parked with more flexibility. I doubt one could just tear ass down the sidewalk on Bd. du Port-Royal at full speed without incident, but it's not like motorcycles have to follow exactly the same rules as cars.\n\nSpeaking of cars: they're tiny over there. Like, super-tiny. The Mini Cooper is actually a fairly normal-sized car by Parisian standards. Not many people over there are buying SUVs to tow campers they'll never actually buy.\n\nOh, and remember the hype surrounding the Segway when it was first announced? How Apple CEO Steve Jobs was quoted as saying (and I paraphrase) 'people won't have to rebuild their cities around this thing, it'll just happen'? Because the streets in Paris are so bike- and scooter-friendly you would think that Paris would be one of the most Segway-friendly cities in the world. Yet I saw not a single Segway, nor anything like it. Hundreds of Stella and Vespa scooters, hundreds of motorcycles, thousands of bikes and even a few skateboards and Razor scooters, but not one Segway.\n\nGranted, I don't see many of them over here either, but they have found a nice niche among American security firms and police forces who use them to replace horseback and bicycle patrols in urban areas, especially in and around parks. It would seem that Segways would be at least as useful to cops over there, say around the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower, as they are at the Museum Campus or Millennium Park. But they're just not there, and I think the answer is obvious to anyone who's ever watched _Arrested Development_: the Segway is a useless device that makes its rider look like a total moron. Segways are slower than bicycles (yet at least 10 times more expensive) and motorcycles, and at least with a bike you get some enjoyment and exercise, and with a motorcycle you get way more bang for your buck. \n\nThat no one has found a compelling use for a Segway in Paris, of all cities, I think says something about how useful they are in general. And the conclusion I draw from that is that the reason why the Segway seemed like a good idea is because Americans just don't trust each other to act responsibly with moving vehicles. We want to get around quickly without walking, but we don't want to risk getting run over or falling down. So Dean Kamen invented a mobility device that runs so slowly that getting hit with one would, at worst, cause a nasty bruise, and which uses very advanced computer technology to prevent falling down. It's a scooter whose sole purpose is to prevent accidents, even if that makes it completely useless for anything but patrolling an urban park.\n\nNot long after I moved to Chicago, some friends and I were going out to a movie, and I suggested that since the theater was less than a mile away, we should walk there. And they all looked at me like I was nuts. Americans are too lazy to walk, and too cowardly to risk their necks driving anything smaller than a four-door sedan with side-impact airbags and a good insurance policy. I'm not saying those things aren't useful, but the fact that they are useful is symptomatic of something very wrong with how we choose to get around even in our densest cities.\n\nAnd sadly, in the last decade or two the \"hot\" models for urban planning in the U.S. have not been dense, concentrated urban areas like New York and Chicago, but rather distributed, car-friendly cities like Houston and Los Angeles. And we wonder why this winter is so freaking warm."

    author: "ddemaree"

    body: "So last Monday Roxio released Toast 8 Titanium, the latest release of the venerable, powerful Mac disc-burning app. There are a few kinda interesting new features -- for one, it now keeps a history of all your burns, not unlike Disco's \"Discography\" feature -- but what made headlines was the announcement that Toast 8 includes the long-awaited Mac version of TiVoToGo, which gives users the ability to download videos stored on TiVo Series2 PVRs.\n\nI've been waiting for a Mac version of TiVoToGo for ages, but like many other people I naturally assumed that when it finally arrived it would be included in TiVo's own Desktop software, not in a third-party app that costs four times what TiVo charges for their Windows client. (TiVo Desktop _used to be_ free, and older versions still are, but they started charging for new releases after they introduced the video-transfer feature.)\n\nThis is another one of those situations, like the iPhone, where I can only do so much complaining. It makes some sense to offer TiVoToGo and Toast together, since you would need Toast to burn any of your TiVo recordings to DVD anyway. Even back when TiVoToGo was included in the 100% free TiVo Desktop app for Windows, you had to buy Sonic/Roxio burning software to do anything with the videos, so the argument could be made that to offer TiVoToGo for the Mac outside of this Toast bundle would really only give users the power to clutter their hard drives with massive, encrypted, unplayable video files. And the new Toast includes not only the ability to burn them to a video DVD, but also to unlock and convert them for the video iPod or PSP.\n\nWhat makes this unpleasant is that, well, I've already _paid_ for the videos on my TiVo. I pay a substantial wad of cash to Comcast every month for cable TV, and advertisers have paid even more money to run commercials during the shows I've recorded. I also pay \$12.95 a month to subscribe to TiVo's service, and I paid at least a hundred bucks for my TiVo box. Now I've paid an additional \$100 to Roxio for the privilege of moving these shows to a computer.\n\nAnd really, what am I getting for that \$100? The files that download from the TiVo to my hard drive are recorded at 400 lines of resolution, which is smaller and lower-fidelity than a regular analog video image. My Series2 TiVo has quite possibly the world's slowest network card (understandable, since originally TiVo's networking features were intended only for downloading program info from TiVo, not for moving video around the house), so downloading a single 1-hour TV program takes over two hours. I don't know if the Series2 DT models are any faster, though given that they were released after TiVoToGo was announced I would hope so.\n\nOnce the video is fully transferred to my computer, I have two options: either burn it to a DVD or spend another hour converting it to a format the iPod can read. DVD video is 640 &times; 480 pixels, and TiVo recordings appear to be captured at 400 &times; 400. Therefore burning a TiVo recording to a DVD involves upconverting it, and I can't imagine that there's not a huge loss of picture quality. (And in case you were wondering, yes, TiVo does make a high-def model -- the \$800 Series3 -- but it doesn't support TiVoToGo transfers of any kind.)\n\nAs for iPod transfers, while the video iPods now support videos at full 640 &times; 480 resolution, TiVo has capped the size of transferred videos to 320 &times; 240. That's the same size as the iPod's screen, so if you're watching a transferred TiVo show on the iPod itself you'll have no complaints. However, if I wanted to hook the iPod up to a TV or watch the transferred video on an Apple TV box, my gorgeous HDTV set would be filled with a blurry, pixelated mess. The quality wouldn't even be as good as last year's TV downloads from iTunes (which were 320 &times; 240): a TiVo recording is an analog signal that's been downconverted in real time to a medium-quality MPEG video, then demuxed and downconverted again to a smaller format. It's at least two digital generations away from a clean, clear picture.\n\nSo this long-awaited feature -- for which TiVo and Roxio have seen fit to require customers to pay \$100 to buy disc-burning software they may not otherwise need -- only gets you a seriously compromised version of the TV recordings you've already paid for.\n\n\n## A Modest Proposal ##\n\nIt really makes one think: if you add up the total cost of a year of cable TV (at \$70 monthly for Digital Cable), plus the cost of a 12-month TiVo subscription, for me that would come to about \$1096. And I realize that I'm making the kind of stupid financial comparison I spent a billion paragraphs destroying in my iPhone post, but bear with me here.\n\nThe typical cost of an iTunes season pass is \$40, and at peak I watch maybe eight or nine shows, so those season passes would cost me about \$360. A four-week Multi-Pass to The Daily Show or The Colbert Report costs \$10, so if I wanted to keep myself 100% up-to-date with those shows I'd end up spending about \$120 a year. If we wanted to keep everything 100% fair -- since both cable and TiVo subscriptions include equipment -- we may want to toss in \$300 for an Apple TV box.\n\nAltogether, for a not-so-heavy TV watcher like myself to get his TV programming _only_ from iTunes would cost \$780, for a \$316 annual savings compared to Comcast and TiVo. Obviously your mileage may vary: you can't channel-surf on iTunes, nor could I sample a new season or show by just TiVoing one episode to see if I like it, as I'm doing with _24_ tonight. And while a _lot_ of shows are available on iTunes now, there are still some that aren't.\n\nOn the other hand, while being able to sample a show is convenient, it's not _free_ -- I'm paying for cable and TiVo, to the tune of \$85 a month, and if I were to work out exactly how much I'm paying per hour of television I actually watch, I'm not sure that it wouldn't be the same price or cheaper to just buy episodes _a la carte_ from iTunes.\n\nAnd to answer the question of why I'm paying \$70 a month for digital cable when I don't watch that much TV, it's like this: cable companies have lately started to move all but their cheapest, lamest channels to more expensive and profitable digital plans. A couple of years ago, not having digital cable would have meant that I couldn't watch IFC or Al Gore's vlog-tastic Current TV. Nowadays, at least here in Chicago, to forego digital would mean going without _Battlestar Galactica._ Because cable subscribers have no control over which channels they get for their money, if Comcast decides that a channel airing a show I like is only going to be available on their \"Plus\" tier my only options are to upgrade or stop watching that show.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, cable is still a pretty good entertainment value: the quality is decent enough, and you get unlimited access to all kinds of programming, some of which doesn't even suck. And no amount of bitching over the limitations of TiVoToGo will make owning a TiVo any less useful. But if you place a premium on being able to access your videos on a wide range of devices, the cable companies and TiVo are not so much your friends, is all I'm saying."

    title: "The iPhone, Damned Lies and Statistics"

    body: "I just saw [this post on Consumerist about the true cost of the iPhone](http://consumerist.com/consumer/iphone/iphones-true-cost-1936-228611.php), including not just the \$600 to buy the thing but also one year of Cingular service with the sort of rate plan and data/messaging add-ons you'd need to make the most of it. The total: \$1,936. That's a scary number, until you consider the following:\n\n* **They used the \$599 cost of the 8 GB iPhone.** Not having seen anything more of the iPhone than [what's on the website](http://www.apple.com/iphone/), what was shown in the keynote video and what's been said in press coverage since Tuesday, I'd probably recommend that if you're gonna do the iPhone thing at all you should probably go for the 8 GB version. However, I can't honestly say that you're missing much at 4 GB: even the larger-capacity iPhone can't hold enough video content to make it useful for, say, a long flight, and video playback eats into talk time.\n\n\tAnd speaking only for myself here, the only times I ever use my video iPod for video are when I hook it up to my TV to watch something I've downloaded from the iTunes Store, and the [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/) I just ordered is about to make even that paltry video-watching obsolete. However, I did buy an 8 GB nano back in October because I wanted an iPod with a long-lasting enough battery that I could use it for several days' worth of commuting without recharging. In short: I may never, ever use the video features on the iPhone, and 4 GB is more than enough space for a few days' worth of music.\n\n\tDouble the capacity for only a hundred bucks is a pretty decent value, which is why I'd recommend the 8 GB model if cost isn't a factor. But if it is, just remember that the truly killer features of the iPhone don't require very much space, so you can probably go with the 4 GB model. At least until Apple comes out with a model that can hold more video and play it back longer without eating into your talk time.\n\n* **They assumed you'd be using a current Cingular data plan priced at \$40/month:** Both [Cingular/AT&T](http://cingular.com/) and Apple have hinted that there may be special iPhone plans available when the thing comes out in June, which would fall between the \$20/mo plans for regular cell phones and the \$40/mo plans for PDAs. (This is one rare arena where it may be a good thing that you can't install third-party apps on the iPhone.)\n\n\tI'm currently paying a total of \$25 a month for unlimited data and 400 messages on [T-Mobile](http://t-mobile.com/), so even this \$40/month plan they're talking about here could conceivably save me some money. However, also consider how many minutes/messages you actually use in a given month. More importantly, consider whether you're using them _right now_, without the temptation of the iPhone's glossy, sexy touchscreen and super-simple SMS app. I'd say I send or receive about 200 messages each month, on average, plus about 2.5 MB of data. I'd imagine the data use would go up with an iPhone, but that's not necessarily the case with text messaging.\n\n\tMy point: if you're not doing a lot of text messaging or mobile data stuff right now, you can probably go with a lesser add-on plan and save \$5-15 per month, which would shave at least a hundred dollars off of that estimate.\n\n* **And don't you already have a cell phone?** Continuing that last train of thought, when you hear a FUD-ridden number like \$1936 per year, remember that a certain percentage of that (specifically, \$720 of it) is for a regular \$60/month rate plan. That's more than I'm paying right now, but I don't make a lot of calls. \n\n\tCenterNetworks, the website that came up with the scary number, chose the \$60 rate because it's Cingular's least expensive plan that includes unlimited nights and weekends. Unlimited nights and weekends are a very popular and useful thing, so I gotta ask: if someone is already using a cell phone, aren't they somewhat likely to be on that rate plan already?\n\n\tSuch folks may not have a media bundle on their plan -- so to get the most out of an iPhone they'd end up spending more than they are now, certainly -- but those folks have certainly already budgeted that \$800+ per year for their regular cell phone service. And people who already use some kind of smartphone or PDA are probably already paying for some kind of data access, which would if anything be _cheaper_ with an iPhone.\n\t\nSo if you're already on a rate plan that costs at least \$60 per month and spending at least \$40/month on messaging or data services, the only additional cost for you would be the cost of the iPhone itself, and there's no reason to spend the extra hundred bucks for the higher-end model unless you're going to be using more as an iPod than as a phone.\n\nMe, I anticipate that if I get an iPhone I'll probably end up using it for music rather than video, and I can live with not being able to carry every single Decemberists album with me at all times. Of course, I can also just skip the iPhone altogether and stick with my trusty Nokia and (relatively) inexpensive T-Mobile plan.\n\nAs for my overall reaction to the iPhone, I've started and abandoned at least three posts on the subject this week and at this point I'm prepared to say I have nothing to add to the overall discussion. I think that the iPhone would be a more attractive product if it had a swappable battery, some way to expand the storage (would it have killed Steve Jobs to have a little SD-HC slot on the side?) and an open architecture allowing for the sort of awesome third-party apps that have so spoiled us Mac users in recent years. I could also complain about the fact that the iPhone is locked to Cingular/AT&T, requiring anyone who wants a decent user experience in their pocket to get in bed with a company I absolutely _loathe_.\n\nHowever, while those things would make a more attractive product, that's simply not the product Apple is releasing in June. I can accept that the paltry-seeming storage and battery life are necessary technical concessions required to make the iPhone so small and sleek. I can accept that Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive are zealots who hate holes and seams, especially if said holes (like a memory card slot) make it easy for customers to put off upgrading for a few years. Hey, it's their party, so whatever.\n\nAnd I can even understand the Cingular deal, given that the iPhone's \"visual voicemail\" is a proprietary feature dependent on special network support -- in this case, the fact that Apple is working so closely with the carrier could be considered a feature, not a bug.\n\nUltimately I'd just compare it to those wireless Palm devices (like the Palm VII) that preceded the Treo, which used their own completely closed radio network that (naturally) was only available in major cities with a lot of Palm users. A more apt comparison could perhaps be made to the Blackberry, which requires not only a data plan from your mobile carrier but a subscription to the push e-mail service that makes a Blackberry a Blackberry.\n\nIt's not like the iPhone is the first wireless gadget to be dependent on a certain network or service, it's just that because the iPhone uses more or less open protocols like GSM, EDGE and Wi-Fi, it seems like kind of an arbitrary dependency. But no one was forced to buy a Palm VII, and no one's going to be forcing anyone to buy an iPhone this summer. It just so happens that (at least in the U.S.) the iPhone is part and parcel with Cingular's network. Whether that's a good or bad thing for you depends entirely on how you feel about Cingular.\n\n\n### Stupid Corporation Tricks ###\n\nSpeaking of Cingular: _good job_, everyone, for announcing the iPhone with much hype and ballyhoo as being a Cingular exclusive just six days before their parent company, the diabolically reformed Ma Bell, begins phasing out the Cingular brand name in favor of their own Death Star-meets-Willy Wonka brand identity.\n\nThere's a very good reason why AT&T couldn't announce their new re-branding plan until after the keynote -- their merger with BellSouth, giving them total ownership and control over Cingular, wasn't approved until later in the week -- but it does seem to be a waste of brand awareness mojo to have Apple spend the week talking up \"Cingular\" when that name is due to be retired less than six months after the first iPhones ship.\n\nOf course, that's just inconvenient. The true example of corporate stupidity this week is the trademark spat between Apple and Cisco over the iPhone name itself. Cisco has had an all-but-dormant trademark registration for the name \"iPhone\" for years. They hastily announced some Linksys VoIP phones last month carrying the iPhone brand, presumably because the trademark was due to expire at the end of 2006 if it wasn't in active use, and Apple was (also presumably) sniffing around to see if they could snatch it up for their new cell phone.\n\nI'm no expert in trademark law, so it's hard for my untrained eyes to figure out who's being stupider here: Apple for playing chicken with the courts right on the heels of the options backdating scandal and a similarly silly trademark fight with Apple Corps, or Cisco for letting a valuable trademark sit unused for years and then suing Apple for actually having paid attention in class, so to speak. My prediction is that Apple would probably win in court (it's really hard to argue that Cisco has an ironclad claim to a brand name they couldn't be bothered to use for four years), but that they'll probably reach some kind of concession with Cisco before it can come to trial.\n\nMostly I'm just struck by the arrogance at work here. Who the hell puts themselves out there by announcing a \"revolutionary\" new mobile phone -- the kind of hot product that ends up on the front page of every newspaper and the cover of every magazine -- without first making double-sure that they can actually call it the iPhone? It's not enough for one's lawyers to be pretty sure they could win a legal fight. The fight itself is enough to breed confusion, which is enough to erode customers' confidence.\n\nApple fans have had a very nice decade of not having to worry about whether the company would still be around next year. Between the options scandal, Jobs's cancer scare and crap like this, one starts to wonder if maybe the new Apple's cockiness won't do a better job destroying them than the old Apple's abject stupidity ever did."

    title: "It's A Wonderful MacWorld"
    author: "ddemaree"

    body: "Oh yes, my children, it is that time of year again. Steve Jobs is scheduled to take the stage tomorrow morning at 9 AM Pacific Time for the keynote address at the annual MacWorld Expo in San Francisco (MWSF), and as always he is expected to announce at least one jaw-dropping new Apple product.\n\nMy predictions and thoughts:\n\n### What To Definitely Expect ##\n\n* **The Unexpected:** There are some smart-aleck Mac watchers who think they know what's going to happen tomorrow. I'm sure there's someone out there who's even got it all mapped out -- a minute-by-minute breakdown of what Steve Jobs is going to say, from an update on Apple retail and iPod sales, to demos of Leopard, iLife and iWork, right through to the iTV and One More Thing: the iPhone.\n\n\tWell, these people are wrong. Sure, there's always some things announced in the Stevenote that are easy to predict (I'd say iLife and iWork are mortal locks, and I'll be way surprised if iTV doesn't get at least a mention), but the biggest, most wonderful announcements are always the ones we never saw coming. And even if the pundits are 100% right, and Apple announces exactly the new products people expect them to, it's impossible to be prepared for how cool it is to finally _see_ them and hear Steve Jobs talk about them.\n\t\n\tIn other words: yeah, sure, there may be an iPod phone tomorrow. But be prepared to find that everything you thought you knew about the iPhone is wrong.\n\n### What To Expect ###\n\n* **A. Freaking. Cell phone.** I had originally posted the long-fabled \"iPhone\" in the \"Possibles\" column, as something that a lot of people were talking about but which I didn't actually believe would ever actually happen.\n\n\tWell, [the _Wall Street Journal_ is reporting that the Apple phone is real](http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116830347326670832.html%3Fmod%3Ddjemalert) (subscription required), and they've reached a hush-hush agreement with Cingular to be the exclusive U.S. carrier. Whether this means that Apple will be pushing a special Apple-branded Cingular plan (bringing the famous Jobsian ease of use to one of the most horrifying things in high tech, the choosing of a cell phone plan) or just letting Cingular have a period of exclusivity before releasing the phone to other carriers is unclear.\n\t\n\tI would _hope_ that it's the former, and if it is the case that it's some new \"Apple Mobile\" wireless service that's simply \"powered by\" Cingular's network, I might be sorely tempted to switch my wireless service. A sexy, easy-to-use mobile gadget is one thing, but if Apple can do for cell phone service what they did for movie and music downloads, _that_ would be revolutionary.\n\t\n\tAt any rate, this is all still rumor and conjecture until Jobs pulls an iPhone out of his pocket (or not) in about 15 more hours. But leaving aside the _Journal_'s long reputation for reporting facts, remember that they're the ones who scooped the world by confirming the Apple-Intel deal in 2005, days before it was officially announced at WWDC.\n\t\n\tElsewhere in the mainstream media, the _New York Times_ is under the impression that this Apple cell phone will be more than just an iPod that makes calls, but rather a whole new category of gadget that combines digital entertainment with next-level wireless communications features -- in short, a smartphone that finally doesn't suck.\n\n* **iLife '07:** A mortal lock -- there _will_ be a new iLife unveiled tomorrow, and I'm sure there will be one or two interesting bullet-point features for each app, along with the expected performance improvements. Me, I'm hoping to see some [major improvements to iWeb](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0608iweb2-2.html), which right now is completely useless unless you're using it in combination with .Mac and the other iLife apps. I'd also love some more powerful editing tools in iPhoto or GarageBand, but that's what Aperture and Logic Express are for, so maybe not.\n\n* **iWork '07:** There will absolutely be a new iWork revision announced tomorrow; the big question is whether Apple will finally unveil their long-rumored spreadsheet product. Apple's been without a basic spreadsheet since they started to phase out AppleWorks in favor of iWork two years ago, and while Pages's built in table creation isn't terrible, there are times when you just want to be able to drag-drop or import some data from Excel and you just _can't._ With a spreadsheet, iWork is a simple yet viable alternative for home and SOHO users who just don't need all the clutter and hassle of Microsoft Office. Without one, it's just Keynote with a wonky page layout app.\n\n   Speaking of which: I sincerely hope that [Think Secret's report about Pages 3 having a \"word processing mode\"](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0607pages3.html) is on the level. Pages is a nice little app and I use it all the time for producing business documents, like deal memos and proposals. However, it's so layout-focused that it's hard to write in, so I usually end up crafting the text in TextMate (using Markdown for formatting), then converting it to HTML, then importing that into Pages. I would _love_ to be able to just switch out of Pages's layout view and just write the damned thing _in Pages_.\n\n   Oh, and while I don't honestly expect this rumor to pan out, I think some easy way to do a Keynote presentation from a video iPod would be _awesome._ But it's probably not going to happen.\n\n* **Mac OS X Leopard:** _Of course_ Jobs is going to talk about it, and it wouldn't surprise me if a rather large portion of the Keynote is devoted to showing off the new OS. If history is any indication, while we'll probably see some minor things that weren't mentioned or shown back in August at WWDC, the presentation at MacWorld will probably stick pretty close to Leopard's biggest, most consumer-friendly new goodies -- Time Machine, Spaces and the new versions of Safari, Mail and iChat.\n\n\tI also think it's unlikely that we'll get a final price or release date tomorrow, which (again) would be consistent with OS X Tiger's release in 2005. Leopard will _not_ be released this week, this month or even this quarter. Me, I'm betting on an April or May release, at the familiar price of \$129.\n\t\n\tOh, and this is just a hunch, but I feel like Jobs is going to lay off the Microsoft- and Vista-bashing tomorrow, at least somewhat. Why? Because the word is that they have got a _killer_ keynote, and to spend more than a short minute pointing out how Vista's best new features are all ripped off from last year's OS X when every technology columnist in the country has already done it just sounds petty.\n\n* **\"iTV\":** I'm not 100% certain that Apple is ready to begin shipping the home entertainment integration gadget codenamed \"iTV\" (that they previewed at the \"Showtime\" iPod event back in September), but it would shock me if Jobs didn't at least mention it. And it would also shock me if whatever is shown tomorrow were to differ at all from what was shown back then; I'd expect the user interface to be more polished, and for Jobs to be able to demonstrate how it integrates with the Mac, but that's about it.\n\n\tI do _not_ expect Apple to announce a line of plasma TVs with iTV technology built in, nor do I anticipate that the iTV has suddenly morphed into the TiVo-killing Apple DVR people have been dreaming about for years. Because that would just be silly.\n\t\n\t\n### Possibles ###\n\n* **New AirPort Wireless Doo-Dads:** I place this under \"Possibles\" only because the information I've seen today is sketchy, but it looks like Apple may be releasing a couple of next-generation Wi-Fi devices called the AirPort Extreme X2 and X4. Based only on a quick chat with the voices in my head and common sense, I'd guess that one or both of these products -- if they exist -- are based on the new 802.11n high-speed Wi-Fi specification, offering more stable connections and speeds of up to -- holy crap -- 300 Mbps. And that Jobs will make a point to mention that most recent Intel Macs already come with 802.11n-capable wireless cards, so they can be made \"AirPort Extreme X-whatever Ready\" with (hopefully) a simple firmware upgrade.\n\n* **New iSights / New Cinema Displays with built-in iSights:** Yeah, they _would_ come out with cool new displays right after I buy a 23-inch Cinema for my office. The built-in iSight is the focal point for a _lot_ of cool new features in Leopard (and in iLife '07, I'd imagine), and yet Mac mini and Mac Pro users (as well as folks like me who use their MacBook Pros hooked up to an external display) have to either buy the external FireWire iSight (which hasn't been substantively redesigned or changed in _three and a half years_) or just go without Photo Booth. So the possibility has been raised that Apple might either revamp the Cinema Display to include the same built-in iSight as found on Macs with built-in screens, or that the external iSight might be given a major overhaul. Not sure how likely this one is yet, but it has a smack of truth to it. (And ham.)\n\n* **Final Cut Express 4:** Let me be clear: I've read no rumors on the internets saying that there will be or might be a new Final Cut Express announced at MacWorld -- this is just me speculating, since unless you count the updates released last year for Intel compatibility, _none_ of Apple's pro audio or video apps have been substantively updated since 2005.\n\n\tI really don't think Apple would use MacWorld to announce new versions of Final Cut Studio or Logic, but it's been almost two years since Final Cut Pro's had a new major release (not counting the update for Intel compatibility last year), and new versions of Final Cut Express are usually based on Final Cut Pro code that's due to be retired. So if Apple were planning to announce a new Final Cut Studio release at NAB in April, it might also be an opportune time for them to announce an Express release that incorporates some new goodies rolled over from FCP 5.\n\t\n* **New Mac Pros:** This one is only on the radar because Intel just announced the quad-core Xeon 5300 processor, and so it would seem likely that Apple will introduce a dual-processor, _eight-core_(!!!) Mac Pro either tomorrow or shortly thereafter, affording Steve and/or Phil Schiller yet another opportunity to tell us how Macs are now both faster and cheaper than your funky old Dell. MacWorld is often more consumer-oriented, so I'm not sure whether Apple would take time away from fun stuff to announce a ridiculously overpowered workstation Mac, just so they could run the World's Fastest Photoshop Test. But _they just might_, because that's just the kinda crazy Steve Jobs is. \n\t\n* **New Mac minis or iMacs:** Again, nothing to support this on the internets, but both of these products are getting long in the tooth and MacWorld is the traditional place to roll out cool new models. Both the Mac mini and iMac got a speed bump in September, and the iMac's high-end model was upgraded to a 24&rdquo; screen. But neither has been substantively changed since 2005, so maybe it's time for them to evolve. On the other hand, the G4 iMac lasted 44 months without a major redesign, and the Mac mini is such a bare-bones product that I'm not sure what else could be done apart from making it faster, smaller or cheaper.\n\n\n### What Not To Expect ###\n\n* **Ultraportable MacBook:** I believe there will inevitably be a superthin, superlight Mac portable -- just not yet. Just doesn't seem like the right occasion, and it would be competing for stage time with iLife, iWork, Leopard, iTV and whatever else Steve has got.\n\n* **Mac tablet:** Absolutely not. Tablets are one of those things that seem cooler and more high-tech than they actually are, Windows tablet sales are less than stellar, and there's simply no need to Apple to branch out into a niche market just because they still have some handwriting recognition technology laying around from the old Newton.\n\n* **The \"true\" video iPod:** Because the video iPod sitting right in front of me on my desk can't really play video, it's just a cruel trick of the eye. Just as with the Mac tablet, the only people asking for this product are gadget nerds, and Apple designs products for _everybody_. The current fifth-gen iPods are still music players first and foremost, with a basic video capability that makes them good for commuting or travelling without adding the bulk and heft of, say, a portable DVD thingy or PSP. And anyone who still has or has ever used a third-gen iPod should really think twice before saying they want a touchscreen iPod. I for one prefer to have real buttons to press.\n\n* **Or any new iPod, really:** At this point I think the iPod has outgrown MacWorld. While the Stevenote at MWSF is still the single biggest Apple event of the year, the fall iPod events have achieved almost equal stature and are conveniently scheduled right before the holiday shopping season. The focus tomorrow will be on Macs, Mac software and _maybe_ digital media (i.e., the Mac as digital hub). Could there be a hot new iPod accessory? Sure, but I'd expect Apple to hold off on any major additions or revisions to the core iPod family until later in the year, if not until next September. (And yes, I am including a Beatles iPod in this, because neither Apple nor Apple Corps would want that announcement to be upstaged by _anything_.)\n\n* **And just because it bears repeating,** the following things will _not_ be announced at tomorrow's Keynote:\n\n\t* Apple making Mac OS X available for non-Apple computers\n\t* Built-in virtualization in Leopard\n\t* A new Finder\n\t* Return of the Newton\n\n\n### More about that \"Apple Mobile\" service ###\n\t\nI just ran across [this post on the blog SeekingAlpha](http://ce.seekingalpha.com/article/22383) that cites a UBS analyst as saying Apple would be starting up an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) -- in other words, their own wireless service -- using Cingular's network. Now, analyst reports are just a very specialized form of conjecture, so until Jobs says it's happening nobody knows anything.\n\nBut I did want to amplify my thoughts on the whole MVNO possibility. One data point that is sure to be mentioned by every business reporter and pundit following today's keynote (if indeed Apple is announcing their own mobile service) is that Disney's much-hyped Mobile ESPN service was a total flop, and shut down operations on Dec. 31 with all customers' plans being rolled over to Sprint, the major carrier providing the network for ESPN.\n\nThe difference is that ESPN's big added-value feature was mobile content; apart from getting sports scores and videos on a stunningly unsexy phone, there was nothing to clearly distinguish Mobile ESPN from any other cell phone company, and there are many cheaper ways to get sports content.\n\nApple wouldn't be doing this just to put their own brand on the same old Cingular service you can use with any other device. I would think the more apt comparison would be with Earthlink's Helio service, which provides tight integration between their devices (which are exclusive to Helio) and their service, as well as a strong emphasis on mobile internet features like MySpace Mobile (which is also exclusive to Helio).\n\nThe really interesting thing about Helio -- and why it's the most likely model for whatever Apple would attempt in this space -- is that they really like to steer customers toward an all-in-one service plan which includes unlimited messaging and, more significantly, unlimited data on Sprint's high-speed 3G network. Their plans tend to be a bit more expensive (\$65/mo for 500 anytime minutes; Cingular's most comparable plan is \$40 and T-Mobile's is even less) but what you're paying for is the assurance that you won't be nickel-and-dimed on non-calling stuff like text messages and mobile internet, and that because you're buying a Helio phone and Helio service, that everything will Just Work.\n\nHelio's always seemed like an interesting offering -- and at \$65/month for unlimited messaging and data, I'd be losing 500 anytime minutes I don't ever use and would save a _lot_ of money compared to my current T-Mobile plan -- except for the fact that I don't really like any of their phones, and being on Sprint's network there's no way to bring in your own. If Apple can offer a no-hassle cell phone service and a sexy, usable mobile device to go with it, that could be a game-changer. Hell, if they can offer some kind of flat-rate pricing that makes sense I would switch even without the iPhone.\n\n\n### One More Thing... ###\n\nWhatever gets announced tomorrow, I think I can safely predict that some part of it will involve .Mac, Apple's \$99/year subscription service offering file storage, e-mail and quick, easy publishing for all your various digital crap from iLife. I'm a cynic when it comes to .Mac, a product that exists only because there's a large portion of Apple's target audience who simply may not know that you can access your free Gmail account from Mail, or that you can buy a \$25 plugin that lets you post photos to Flickr directly from iPhoto, or that there are file storage options way faster and cheaper than the iDisk, like Joyent's new BingoDisk! service which offers 25 GB (compared to 1 GB on .Mac) of the same kind of WebDAV storage as iDisk for less than half the price of a one-year .Mac subscription.\n\nAt any rate, I know I'm not alone in feeling that _.Mac has to be stopped._ At \$99/year, it is way, _way_ overpriced for a service that's really little more than some web space and an e-mail address. The iDisk is convenient, sure, but only in the Finder: you can open your iDisk by just hitting Command-Shift-I, but that puts you at the mercy of the Finder's notoriously flaky internet sharing abilities.\n\nMoving files to or from the iDisk is _slow_ work, and you may be surprised to learn that that has _nothing_ to do with Apple's servers. If you open your iDisk in a file transfer program like Transmit or Interarchy, or even as a Web Folder on Windows, it gets much faster and more reliable. The problem with iDisk is with the Finder, pure and simple. But without the Finder and the convenient iDisk access it affords, you're really just overpaying for a 1 GB WebDAV share.\n\nIt may well be the case -- oh, believe me, I hope it to be the case -- that Leopard will be the OS X release that _finally_ resolves some long-standing issues and makes the Finder usable again. But that doesn't address the problem, which is that the current Mac Finder is total crap (at least when it comes to network file sharing), and so .Mac subscribers are paying \$99 year to have convenient access to a feature that doesn't really work, and their best hope is to pay \$129 more in April to maybe fix that.\n\nAnd the iDisk isn't even the flakiest part of .Mac -- that honor belongs to .Mac Sync, which until recently was the only feature of the service I used on a regular basis. And since I'm not an expert on all the fine technical points of why .Mac Sync is a total steaming pile of evil, allow me to quote such an expert, [Ars Technica's John Siracusa](http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits.ars/2006/12/22/6389):\n\n> The idea behind .Mac syncing is attractive: share and coordinate application data among several Macs. This includes email accounts, encrypted passwords, calendar events, bookmarks, contacts, and so on.\n\n> All this syncing is subject to the same slowness and unreliability as the rest of .Mac, but that's not where the aforementioned \"boundless evil\" comes from. .Mac's sync services are available to third-party developers as well, and that's where the real trouble starts.\n\n> It's one thing for .Mac to suck in isolation. It's another thing entirely for it to infect all your favorite applications. Thanks to the ubiquity of .Mac (every Mac sold has the software to use it pre-installed) and Apple's efforts to push the Sync Services API, pretty much every Mac OS X application that has to do any sort of network syncing does so through .Mac. And .Mac, as we know, is slow and unreliable. This, in turn, makes the applications that use it slow and unreliable.\n\nAnd I could bore you for days complaining about how .Mac and iWeb are Hurting the Internet.\n\nSo here's my proposal. I'll say once again, this is nothing that's been rumored, or for that matter that I have any expectation of actually happening. But it's what _should_ happen:\n\n* Apple needs to either make .Mac into a better value -- like 100 GB (or even 50 or 25) for \$99/year (or \$69 or \$49) -- or they just need to stop charging money for it. To be able to publish your cool iLife content to .Mac with a single click is nice, but no one will ever convince me that Apple needs to charge \$99/year to provide 1 GB of storage space that isn't even SSL-encrypted or reliably accessible from the Finder. It's not just the quality of the service that I'm talking about here: \$99/year for the best, most reliable 1 GB of storage space is still too much money. Apple is a tremendously profitable company; surely they can afford to make some basic level of .Mac service available for free.\n\n* If iDisk is going to stall the Finder for four minutes because I accidentally hit Cmd-Shift-I instead of Cmd-Shift-O, then Apple can either fix the problem of just remove iDisk integration from the Finder.\n\n* The same can be said for Sync Services: they need to work 100%, every time, or they need to come out.\n\n* Push-button publishing from the iLife apps is nice and all, but it shouldn't be the only option. They should team up with Google to incorporate a one-click \"Export to YouTube\" feature in iMovie, and make it easy to get photos out of iPhoto and uploaded to Flickr or Picasa Web Albums.\n\nApple is such a brilliant, innovative company. Their web browser is (in my opinion, at least) superior to anything else out there, and their online store for music and movie downloads is the 800-lb gorilla of digital media. It should be so easy for them to create a set of online services that are not only good but essential for any Mac user. And yet .Mac is easily Apple's most worthless product. It's seriously time for Apple to do something about that."

    title: "Adobe Icon Madness"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " Oh, I am so glad to see that (a) I was right that the new &#8220;periodic symbol&#8221; icon design for Photoshop CS3 is in fact the real, final one, and (b) that a number of designers I admire and..."
    body: "<a href=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2006-12-21_big_adobe_wheel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2006-12-21_adobe_color_wheel.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" /></a>\n\nOh, I am _so_ glad to see that (a) I was right that the [new \"periodic symbol\" icon design for Photoshop CS3 is in fact the real, final one](http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2006/12/the_other_cs3_icons.html), and (b) that a number of designers I admire and respect are with me in hating it. Not least because it's not just Photoshop -- the new icon design is being carried over to not just the rest of Creative Suite, but _every single product Adobe sells._ (As well as a few we all thought were dead...PageMaker? Really? PageMaker?)\n\n[Jason Santa Maria](http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2006/12/20/what_a_mess.php) hates it:\n\n> When making icons, you usually try to design something simple and recognizable to identify things. At the expense of creating a family of icons, youâ€™ve watered them down so much as to be unrecognizable at a glance. \n\n> The plain facts that monitor variations kill the subtle differences, and there are quite a few color blind people out there who canâ€™t distinguish certain shades from one another, should have led you towards a backup plan. That may be what the periodic letters are for, but in choosing to go with one font, and one orientation, youâ€™ve created enough noise that none of them would be recognizable among the others. Plus, baking in the action of having to read the icon just to decipher it adds an unnecessary step.\n\n> This is an utter design failure.\n\n[Dave Shea](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/12/20/icont/index.php) hates it:\n\n> Maybe most of the people who have seen them so far just simply donâ€™t like them, but everyone else will. No? No. There are ways to quantify how badly these icons work for their intended purpose.\n\n> They fail because there is no shape variation. Every icon is contained within an identical square. Nothing breaks the silhouette, the only shape variation occurs inside the square, in the form of the letters. But using a common typeface, stroke weight, and posture across every icon means the various letters have more in common with each other than they differ, and at a glance they all blend together.\n\n> And these icons fail because conveying important information through colour must be done with care; the current design appears to sample at random from the colour spectrum.\n\n[Adam Betts](http://www.artofadambetts.com/weblog/?p=170) hates 'em:\n\n> This is what happens when you let the marketing team takes over the graphic designing.\n\nAnd [Veerle Pieters](http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_adobe_icons_and_branding/)...kinda likes it?\n\n> The color association that is carried throughout the product's desktop brand and primary imagery makes total sense to me. The absence of illustrative elements as we saw in previous versions needs really getting use to. If you look in the Dock, most icons are like pictures and visually very detailed so it's like they are all shouting \"choose me, me\". Adobe's new icons are so basic and stand out instantly even in a crowded Dock. That's a thing Macromedia always had with their icons, you could immediately tell they belong together.\n\nMe, I agree totally with Mssrs. Shea and Santa Maria. And with all due respect to Veerle Pieters, I think she's missed the point: I don't think anyone is saying that the icons don't stand out from other companies' icons or that they're not visually appealing. I do happen to think they look nice, and from a purely aesthetic standpoint they are a huge improvement over feathers, sunflowers, butterflies and oddly vaginal seashells.\n\nThe problem is when you apply an almost identical icon template to more than two dozen products, some of which have overlapping uses, some of which have diametrically different uses. Why in the world do we need such a tight, blurry family resemblance between ColdFusion, Audition and RoboHelp? Why is the fact that these products come from the same company _so_ important that they need to share an icon design?\n\nI think the single biggest failure of this new icon system is the use (or rather, gross misuse) of color. Beyond continuing the use of certain colors for certain brands -- red for Flash and Acrobat, yellow-orange for Illustrator, lime green for Dreamweaver -- there is absolutely no logic to where products have been placed on the color wheel, so those of us with perfect color vision aren't getting anything beyond prettiness from the shading of the icons. And people who have trouble seeing color will find these icons more than a little bit inscrutable:\n\n![grayscale adobe wheel](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/blog_images/2006-12-21_grayscale_adobe_wheel.jpg)\n\nAt least with The Feather, you could tell at a glance which one was Photoshop, color or no color. And with the old Photoshop \"eye\" logo, the association between the visuals and the app made perfect sense."

    title: "Photoshop CS3 First Impressions"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "So Adobe decided to give its Intel Mac-using customers an early Christmas present, and release Photoshop CS3 as a public beta on the Adobe Labs site. Before I discuss anything about the software itself, I want to give Adobe mad,..."
    body: "So Adobe decided to give its Intel Mac-using customers an early Christmas present, and release Photoshop CS3 as a public beta on the [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com/) site.\n\nBefore I discuss anything about the software itself, I want to give Adobe mad, mad props for offering CS3 as a public beta. Creative Suite 3 isn't due to be released until next spring, but a _lot_ of Adobe's Mac customers have either already made the switch to Intel or are feeling sorely tempted by those hot new Mac Pros. (If you're not up-to-date on the whole Apple-Intel business, check out [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Intel_transition) that explains the whole sordid affair.)\n\nThe beta program works like this: if you're a licensed owner of Photoshop CS2 or the Creative Suite 2 bundle, you can get a beta serial number that will basically allow you to use the CS3 beta until the final release comes out in a few months. As with all previous Photoshop releases, you can run different versions side by side, so installing and using the CS3 beta doesn't prevent you from switching back to CS2 if you discover that the new version has a crashing bug or some other problem that prevents you from getting work done. \n\nUnlicensed users -- like myself, until today -- get a two-day free trial period, and can buy a CS2 serial number and activate their copy of CS3 at any time. And if you'll allow me a quick digression, since when has Adobe offered the Creative Suite as a download from their website? Good golly, that's convenient. One of the things I always liked about buying software from Macromedia was that it was always possible to unlock the demo versions of their apps by buying a serial number from their website, so that I didn't have to obtain a package CD that I'd just end up stashing in a binder anyway. My only complaint is with Adobe's Flash-based store and shopping cart, which turns using my browser's Back button into an annoying game of \"Hey, Let's Confuse David With Some Needless Ajaxy Bullshit.\" I mean, come on folks -- just because you _can_ use Flash doesn't mean you _should_.\n\n\n## Performance ##\n\nJust to get it out of the way: the performance is pretty darned solid. It's noticeably faster than Photoshop CS2 under Rosetta, especially when switching between Photoshop and another app. (And us web developers tend to do a lot of that.)\n\nThere's a new 'Performance' section of the Preferences that lets you cap the amount of memory available to Photoshop (by default its memory cap is set at 75% of your system memory) and set up scratch disks. The pane also includes information on the GPU on your graphics card, which would imply that CS3 can use your graphics card to handle some tasks, relieving the load on your main processor(s).\n\nBut just when you think the improved performance is the biggest, most obvious change, that's when you notice the new user interface. Photoshop CS3 offers the ability to dock palettes on the sides of your screen, which you can expand or collapse to save screen space. When you collapse a palette dock, the palettes inside it are still available as toolbar icons; clicking an icon brings up that one palette, which goes away as soon as you're done with it. \n\nEven the main Photoshop toolbox has gotten a new look: by default it's arranged in a single vertical column, which frees up some horizontal screen real estate for your images. You can return to the old toolbox style by just clicking it title bar.\n\nAnd in a nice little Mac-like touch, when you switch into or out of Photoshop, the palettes fade in and out smoothly rather than just disappearing and reappearing.\n\n\n## Non-Destructive Editing ##\n\nThe blockbuster feature of CS3 would seem to be the ability to apply filters non-destructively to Smart Objects. I've been really, _really_ wanting Adobe to add some kind of non-destructive filtering to Photoshop for a while now, and it seems odd that it's taken this long given that After Effects has had it for a while. Unfortunately, Smart Filters can only be applied to Smart Objects, which are external files embedded in your document as opposed to normal layers. But hey, non-destructive filters -- I'll take what I can get.\n\nYou can apply any filter as a Smart Filter, and even disable and _reorder_ the filters after you've applied them. Let's say you've applied Gaussian Blur, but you realize you forgot to apply Color Halftone first. All you have to do is apply the Color Halftone filter to your Smart Object, and then drag its name in the Layers palette so that it's under the Gaussian Blur. The image immediately updates, with the Gaussian Blur being applied _after_ the Color Halftone. Pretty sweet. You can also change your filters' settings after you've applied them, so if that 10 pixel blur turns out to have been too much (or too little), you can change it on the fly.\n\n\n## Animation ##\n\nOne thing noticeably absent from the current Photoshop CS3 beta is ImageReady, an app I use maybe once a year when I have to make an animated GIF. Well, it's possible that ImageReady CS3 is just not ready for the public, but it would seem that Adobe have merged ImageReady and Photoshop, because ImageReady's Animation palette is now available in Photoshop. Whenever it's visible, the \"Unify\" toolbar (for locking the visibility or position of certain layers in all frames of an animation) automagically appears in the Layers palette.\n\n\n## Save for Web...And Devices? ##\n\nCS3 comes with a new app, Adobe Device Central, which is intended to make it easy to develop content for mobile devices by providing a micro-sized preview based on the screen size of a given device. Device Central has the first and only obvious bug I could find: it wasn't able to open the temporary file created by Save For Web when you open Device Central from there. And I'm still not 100% clear on what Device Central does, because its device list seems to include only mobile versions of Flash Player rather than, you know, actual mobile devices. I'm sure that's useful, but it looks like more work may be required before this thing is ready for prime time.\n\nApart from that, Save For Web now includes some animation controls so you can optimize individual frames of an animated GIF. And Save For Web now automatically converts images into the sRGB color space before optimizing, something a lot of people assumed it was already doing in CS2 that it wasn't. (You can disable the color space shift by clicking the little triangle button above the optimization settings and unchecking 'Convert to sRGB'.)\n\n\n## Other Useful Stuff ##\n\n* There's a new Auto-Align Layers command which appears to automatically align and position sets of layers based on their content. So if you've taken a series of photos that make up a panorama, you just select those layers and auto-align them.\n\n* There's also an Auto-Blend Layers command, and I'm not entirely sure yet what it does.\n\n* Over in the Edit > Adjustments menu, the Curves dialog has been redesigned, and there is now a helpful Presets dropdown for Curves, Brightness/Contrast, Black & White and Channel Mixer. (Was there a Black & White command in CS2? I only ever use the Channel Mixer to change color into B&W, so I've never noticed it.)\n\n* There is now a nifty Quick Selection tool, which is best described as being like a Magic Wand _brush_.\n\n* Speaking of selections, in the Select menu there's now a Refine Edge command that provides a handy one-stop shop for manipulating selection areas, complete with real-time preview.\n\n\n## Pointless Aesthetic Quibbling ##\n\nI've spent many a blog entry (okay, maybe one or two) complaining about Adobe's campaign to make the Photoshop icons and branding stupider and uglier with each new release, and CS3 is no exception. I remember the heady days of Photoshop 7, when the icon was a cleaned-up, more photorealistic rendering of the classic eye-and-photo-filter Photoshop logo, and you referred to different versions of the app by their _version number_ rather than by which Creative Suite they're bundled with. (Photoshop CS3, by the way, is version 10.)\n\nI loved that eye-and-filter icon; it told you everything you needed to know about Photoshop in one image. Granted, Photoshop has evolved way past just being a photo editor to become the go-to app for all kinds of professional bitmap editing, but photo manipulation is still the still-beating heart of its feature set. So it remains a mystery to me why Adobe would change the icon to _a feather_, of all things, in CS and CS2.\n\nThe feather is pleasant enough, but it communicates nothing. If you look at all the CS/2 icons side by side you certainly get a sense of their family resemblance, true, but without a text label or prior knowledge of which is which, you'd have no idea which one was Photoshop and which one was Illustrator. (I could go on a side rant about Illustrator's long strange icon trip from the _Birth of Venus_ to the world's ugliest flower, but I'd rather not dwell on it.)\n\nAnyway, in the Photoshop CS3 beta the icons have changed once again. Where once we had an eye-and-filter, and then rainbow-colored feathers, we get...a blue gradient square with the letters \"Ps\" in Myriad. That certainly does a better job of communicating that this is Photoshop, as opposed to FeatherPro or UglyIconCentral, but it abandons any attempt at communicating what the app is about. In some ways this is a step up -- the uninitiated could probably figure this one out a lot more easily than the Feather, and the \"Br\" icon for Adobe Bridge is a step up from the ugly, vaguely vaginal seashell it used to have. But it just seems like they're not even trying anymore.\n\nWhat's more, the manner of their non-effort reeks of Macromedia's handling of the Studio MX icons after those apps were bundled together back in 2002. Say what you will about the old icons for Dreamweaver, Flash, et al., they used to have some personality, and that was one of the things that defined Macromedia visually as Not Adobe. Adobe's icons were stately and elegant, while Macromedia's were wilder and more abstract.\n\nThen Studio MX came along, and the icons all changed into...colored spheres with letters on them to denote which one was which. The apps all kept their signature colors (red for Flash, lime green for Dreamweaver, yellow for Fireworks), and I do have to allow that the old icons were sometimes so abstract that nothing important was lost by making it easier to tell which app was which.\n\nI guess I mention that to say this: while Macromedia's icons may have been asking for it, Adobe's weren't. Some latter-day Adobe products' icons, like the InDesign butterfly, may have made no sense, but why not redesign _those_ icons to be more expressive rather than dumb down the ones that were actually working, all in the name of cross-branding?\n\nNow, I am aware that this is a beta, and that these icons may not be final. But the design seems suspiciously consistent with the new visual identity first seen on Acrobat 8 Professional, and I'm not sure why Adobe would use a temp icon that is such a departure from the current Photoshop feather if it weren't intended to be the new identity for the product."

    title: "iPhoto 6 is On Crack"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Because apparently, choosing an external editor has consequences."
    body: "Once, long ago, when iPhoto's built-in editing capabilities were far less advanced than they are now, there was a spot in its preferences screen where you could choose another application to handle editing your photos. For example, if you wanted to use iPhoto to manage your photos while doing all your photo editing mojo in Photoshop, you would go to the preferences and select Photoshop as your external editor. There was also a separate preference where you could select the default edit behavior, which is a nerdy way of saying \"what happens when you double-click on a photo.\"\n\nWell, when iPhoto 6 came out, Apple decided that since most users would probably be doing almost all their retouching and correcting within iPhoto itself, it would therefore be a good time to make those preference choices a little bit simpler:\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/images/2006/11/iphoto_edit_preference.png\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\nNow there is just one \"Edit Photo\" drop-down menu, which seems to give you the following choices for what happens when you double-click on a photo to edit it:\n\n1. You can have the current, \"main\" iPhoto window switch into editing mode and use iPhoto's built-in tools.\n\n2. _Or_ you can have it open a new iPhoto window in editing mode, to use iPhoto's built-in tools.\n\n3. _Or_ you can have it switch into full-screen editing mode, to use iPhoto's built-in tools.\n\n4. _Or_ you can use some application besides iPhoto to edit your photos.\n\nSemantically, that's what a drop-down menu signifies: it asks you to select _one and only one_ option from the list of choices offered, the implication being that having selected one of those choices you were therefore rejecting the other three. If you're given a drop-down menu asking you to choose what U.S. state you live in, you're not saying \"Illinois _and also sometimes Michigan_.\" You're saying \"Illinois,\" and _only_ \"Illinois.\"\n\nAt least, that's how it's supposed to work. Based on that drop-down menu selection, I assumed that if I told iPhoto I wanted to use Photoshop as my external editor, that I would _only_ be able to use Photoshop (or at least, that Photoshop would be the default and I would have to right-click an image to get to the built-in editor), because it's a drop-down menu and I'm limited to one of four choices. In other words, I assumed that if I switched away from having Photoshop as the default, iPhoto would forget that Photoshop was my external editor, because I had set \"Edit Photo\" to Not Photoshop.\n\nSo in the belief that iPhoto just didn't want to let me use Photoshop without making it the default, what I've been doing is just dragging the photo onto the Photoshop icon. There are a couple of kinks to this approach. In iPhoto, when you edit something it always saves the changes to a new file and keeps the original from your camera, so you can always \"revert to original\" if you make an edit that's not working as well as you'd hoped. Well, when I drag something into Photoshop, it doesn't work like that -- it saves the changes to the original, destroying my original digital \"negative.\"\n\nThe other problem, arguably the biggest one, is that unless iPhoto initiates the editing session, it doesn't know to update its thumbnail version of the photo when you're done. So I could make some pretty profound changes to a photo in Photoshop and find that its thumbnail representation in iPhoto was still the same underexposed, off-color thing that came out of my camera. So I ended up with a crazy-ass workflow where I'd make my changes in Photoshop, then find something -- anything -- to do to the photo in edit mode just so the thumbnail would update.\n\nWell, it turns out that if you designate an external editor and then switch back to using iPhoto's built-in tools for editing, it remembers your external editor selection and gives you this handy command when you right-click (or command-click) a photo:\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/images/2006/11/iphoto_rightclick.png\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\nNote that this is _after_ I switched back to using iPhoto's built-in editor. I changed the drop-down menu to Photoshop, then switched back. And _then_ iPhoto would let me edit photos in Photoshop with just a right-click.\n\nThis is spectacularly unintuitive. Back in the day -- the distant heady days of iPhoto 5 -- the \"Edit Photo\" and \"External Editor\" preferences were separate, which was maybe a bit more daunting to total novice users, but certainly more precise. The \"Edit Photo\" preference indicates what you want to have happen when you double-click on a photo; the \"External Editor\" preference is for power users who already have photo editing software that they like and want to use in conjunction with iPhoto. By combining the two settings into one drop-down menu, it seems like you're making one choice when actually you're making one _or two_.\n\nI would say that this is very confusing for inexperienced users, but hell -- I'm a _very_ experienced user, both of Macs in general and iPhoto in particular, and this confused the crap out of me. At least I understand what's going on when I switch my \"Edit Photo\" setting away from Photoshop and yet still see \"Edit with external editor\" in the drop-down menu. A less experienced user may see that and think that iPhoto didn't actually change anything, since a drop-down is supposed to be either-or, not either-and."

    title: "Coming Soon: Practicalmadness.com Redux"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Well, it's been a crazy couple of months, but over the weekend I finally got serious about writing the long-awaited (by somebody, I hope) revamp of Practicalmadness.com."
    body: "Well, it's been a crazy couple of months, but over the weekend I finally got serious about writing the long-awaited (by somebody, I hope) revamp of Practicalmadness.com. \n\nBefore I dive into a discussion of the new code involved, I think I'll give the non-techies in the crowd a quick summary of the planned features and organizational changes:\n\n**Weblog:** The current Practicalmadness.com blog is being more or less retired when the new site launches. That's not to say that the posts are going to disappear; I've already spent a bunch of hours working out a migration plan for the current site, so that all current URLs will continue to work the way they always have. I'm going to be moving the current blog into an \"Archived Posts\" or \"Classic\" section and starting fresh with an all-new main blog. More details on this to come later.\n\n**Recommended:** The Recommended links are not only staying around, but they're getting archive pages and (by request -- thanks, [navelgazer](http://navelgazer.vox.com/)!) born-on dating for the first time. And one of my top-priority new features is a unified RSS feed containing the latest stuff from _all_ parts of the site, which will replace the current main feed. (Of course, the individual blog feeds will stick around as well.)\n\n**Podcasts:** Nobody's asked in a while, but I think I'll just clarify: the Podcast is dead for now. I'm making sure that photocasting and podcasting features are built into the new site, but I'm not bringing over the content from the old Podcast and I don't plan to resume podcasting before the end of the year.\n\n**Comments:** I've gotten at least four dozen spam comments in the past two weeks, and not all of them are getting caught by Movable Type's spam filter. So far this year, when I've gotten legitimate comments they've been thoughtful and useful, and I really want to continue offering a comments feature if it's gonna be used for something besides spam. So while I haven't made any final decisions here I'm considering a few options:\n\n* Requiring authentication for commenters, either using the same _Reader Services_ account system I created for the Oscars Game, or a third-party login service like Yahoo or Google.\n\n* Accepting [OpenID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID), which means that users from [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/) or Technorati could use their logins for those services to comment here.\n\n* Hooking into a spam-filtering web service like [Akismet](http://akismet.com/), or even something on the server like spamassassin.\n\n* Keeping comments open and just moderating them myself.\n\nIf you've got any thoughts or suggestions for how commenting should be handled on this site, please take a second to comment below or e-mail me directly.\n\n**Oscars Game:** I've been toying with the idea of doing away with the Oscars Game, but come on -- I know I'm not actually gonna do it. But I am moving it (and the whole Practical-SPA industrial complex of sites) to its own server, away from the shared hosting account it lives on now, so there won't be any embarrassing crashes on Oscar night next year. Once I get the main Practicalmadness code finished I'll probably start working on some Oscars Game stuff to get a jump on things, so I can have a polished, tested game ready for launch once the nominations are announced. The Oscars Game is a tiny thing, but it's a tradition, and I enjoy it. So look for it to make its annual return in late January.\n\n**New Stuff:** I'm toying with the idea of using the photo gallery portion of the \"Ando\" blogging system I'm building for the new site to bring back my \"Thousand Words\" photo feature, which last appeared on the site in 2003-2004. The only thing that gives me pause is that, well, I've got Flickr for that now. But I think having some way of featuring photos on the homepage, at the very least, would be cool. So there'll at least be something along those lines.\n\n\n## Last But Not Least ##\n\nI've been thinking a lot about some posts from way back in October by [Greg Storey](http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/boxes.php) and [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2006/09/29/blahg/), about how the advent of cheap/free push-button publishing software has led to personal sites all looking and feeling pretty much the same. I know that having your most recent entries on the homepage with links either to expanded content or archive pages is kind of the blog format, but it does tend to deny me a certain level of editorial control.\n\nI think having a highly-focused blog or website, regularly covering only one or very few issues, is a good thing. The problem I have is that I want one website, covering a multiplicity of subjects, while maintaining my own editorial voice and making sure that my readers see the best, highest-signal stuff first, regardless of when it was posted.\n\nSo the biggest change in the new site will be the treatment of the homepage. There will be some chronological lists there, sure -- the most recent posts to the Recommended links list and the proposed new photo feature will probably be given some featured placement. But for the main blog/articles feature, I'm going to assert some greater control: items will show up on the homepage only if I place them there, with a short description written specifically for the homepage placement. There'll be links to the archives section, and I'll probably have an \"other posts\" column showing recent items that didn't rate the top spot.\n\n\n## The Ando Project ##\n\nAs I've mentioned before, after almost five years this site is abandoning [Movable Type](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) and switching to a brand-new homegrown blogging engine, which I've codenamed \"Ando,\" after the renowned Japanese architect [Tadao Ando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando) who designed my favorite gallery at the [Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.artic.edu/). The new code is being built (of course) using the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) web applications framework.\n\nI'm merging in [the Ando photo gallery code I wrote last Spring](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/04/your_own_personal_flickr) (portions of which power [Stop Paying Attention](http://stoppayingattention.com/)) even though I haven't decided if I'm gonna use it here, and the finished code will be available to the public as open source software under an MIT license.\n\nThis isn't to say that I'm releasing a polished, finished blogging app similar to [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com/) or [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/); the primary objective of the Ando Project is to build the new version of Practicalmadness while also developing some useful code and plugins that can be reused on other projects. That could very well _evolve into_ a packaged blogging app, but that's just not my focus right now.\n\nRight now I'm keeping some concepts from Movable Type, specifically this whole notion of multiple blogs each with their own customizable HTML templates and archive pages. But it's on a much lower scale than MT, which I've always complained took more time to configure and design for than I would need to build an entirely new site from scratch. Basically I've got templates for the archive page treatment of each entry, so I can have the software use different HTML for essay-type posts than it uses for the linkblog, while still keeping a consistent search/navigation interface so nobody gets lost.\n\nI've already extracted some useful Rails plugins from Ando, which are publicly available on [Practical's plugins repository](http://svn.practicalmadness.com/svn/plugins/). Among these are `acts_as_importable`, which gives models some convenience methods for importing data in YAML format (such as my entries and comments from the current site), and the awkwardly-named `acts_as_cached_html`, which automatically generates and saves HTML versions of blog posts to the database for faster loading.\n\n\n## ETA are Basque Terrorists ##\n\nSo when will this fabulous new site be ready? When it's done, silly. I've made some major progress so far, and it wouldn't surprise me if I've got something ready to show somebody in another week or two. My immediate goal is to have a finished, working beta ready for browser testing by the first week of December, with a final release before the end of the year so I can move onto finishing a couple of secret projects I'm prepping for release in mid-January.\n\nIn the meantime, I would expect that the volume of posts here will be kinda light. I find Movable Type's web-based UI to be...well, not _that_ bad, but for some reason my server isn't playing as nicely with MarsEdit or TextMate as I would like, and that's really thrown off my workflow for posting nonsense. I'm designing an editing environment for the new site that I just wanna curl up next to and fall in love with, so hopefully once I've got some tools I like the result will be a website I like, and that you'll like too.\n\n\n## Parting Shot ##\n\nAnd before I leave you, I want to say one final thing about Movable Type, Six Apart and my many reasons for investing time in a custom Rails app instead of just redesigning the site I've got now. When Six Apart first opened for business, Movable Type was their one and only product, and it was clearly a labor of love for Ben & Mena Trott. As blogging has become a worldwide phenomenon and Six Apart has grown from a two-person company to an established Silicon Valley powerhouse, I feel like their focus has shifted from building simple, effective tools for making blog-type websites to building communities, like their [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com/) and [Vox](http://vox.com/) services.\n\nThere ain't nothing wrong with that, but I've come to feel that Movable Type has been left behind as they transition from making and giving away/selling software to facilitating these web communities, and as a result they've been totally left in the dust by the aforementioned Mephisto and WordPress. I'll refer back to [my post on the tagging feature in Movable Type 3.3](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/06/tagging_in_movable_type_33) as just one example of how MT isn't really evolving to meet today's blogging needs.\n\nAnd it's a real shame, because while I'm not wild about the technology in MT, I've always liked the user interface and respected the care and attention Mena and the UI team at Six Apart have put into it. From a design standpoint, Movable Type is still one of the most usable blogging packages out there, though unfortunately it's still a creaky old Perl app that's not half as easy to install and keep running properly as the PHP-based WordPress or the Rails-based Typo or Mephisto.\n\nAt this point, my modest proposal to the Movable Type crew at Six Apart would be to start over from scratch and work on building a totally new product that carries over the same great features and design from the current MT, but which is based on a more modern programming language like PHP, with some features to allow for an easy upgrade/migration from the current system to the new one. Now of course, this would break every existing MT plugin, so simply switching from Perl to PHP in a future MT version may not be the way to go. What I'd propose isn't just a new version of MT, exactly, but a whole new product that carries the Movable Type brand name, the same way that Mac OS X carries the Mac OS torch despite having almost nothing in common with the old \"Classic\" OS that preceded it.\n\nWould I stick around if Six Apart were to offer such a thing tomorrow? Probably not -- there are certain benefits to building everything myself, and I enjoy the work. But at some point a lot of heavy-duty MT users who are fed up with having to spend fifteen minutes rebuilding every time they create or update an entry will start looking at their options, and the competition is already pretty fierce."

    body: "So there's a [new version of iTunes out this week](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). Some thoughts:\n\n## There's an Art to Art ##\n\nThe new Cover Flow feature is seriously addictive. I've spent hours this weekend going through my library and downloading art for songs that didn't already have it. I think a big part of the appeal is simply that it makes all these disparate audio and video files seem like a _collection_ rather than just a dry, boring database. Steve Jobs is even right about Cover Flow helping me rediscover my library -- seeing something I'd forgotten about in the library just looks like clutter, but in Cover Flow it looks like something I might want to listen to.\n\nOf course, the new Cover Flow and Album views wouldn't be quite so easy or fun to get into if not for the new automatic artwork downloads from the iTunes Store. Unfortunately I think the artwork downloading feature is a work in progress. A couple of times (possibly when iTunes couldn't settle on any one item from the store that matched a particular query) the download would simply stall out and have to be cancelled before any other artwork could be requested.\n\nAlso, the metadata on your albums has to match the iTS database _precisely_. Belle & Sebastian, for example, is apparently not the same band as Belle _and_ Sebastian (the latter form is the correct one, yet Apple has some albums listed with the ampersand). Album titles must also be an exact match, even if the iTunes version includes some extraneous text like \"(Bonus Tracks)\" or if something is called \"Such And Such - EP\" instead of \"Such And Such EP\".\n\nI'd say I'm able to get artwork hassle-free -- without having to edit an album or artist name or jump through any other hoops -- maybe 3 out of every 5 attempts. That's certainly a better, more convenient thing than I had going yesterday, but some extra fuzziness to the iTunes search engine would help a lot.\n\nI love that video and audio content are now separated into separate libraries, with TV shows organized separately from movies. (I think music videos do still live in the music section, which isn't nearly as awful than suddenly hearing \"Previously, on _Lost_\" while listening to my library on shuffle.) Now if only Apple can find a way to keep all those damned podcasts from being filed under Music we'd be in business.\n\n\n## Games iPod Plays ##\n\nThis is one of those things that I'll admit to hating without having any better idea how it should be done, but it just seems bizarre to me that iPod Games are in the source list. They're not music and can't be played within the iTunes interface -- they're really only there for storage and so iTunes can make sure you've paid for them before they load onto your iPod.\n\nI do appreciate Apple using that space for gameplay instructions, as the Click Wheel is totally unintuitive as a game controller. It's not that controlling the games using the Wheel is difficult -- it's super-easy once you get used to it -- but the controls work differently from game to game, so reading the f**king manual is vital.\n\nI have a Nintendo DS, I have a Nokia cell phone with games on it and I used to have a Palm organizer I mostly used to play Cubis. And yet my video iPod has now become the thing I play video games with on the train, because unlike the DS and the Palm it can be played with _only one hand_, and unlike the cell phone the games don't absolutely suck. Using the click wheel as a joystick to play Pac-Man is pretty awkward, but it's a great controller for Tetris.\n\nAnd those game graphics are positively _luscious_.\n\n\n## Movies from iTunes ##\n\nI've got a few things to say about downloading feature films from the iTunes Store:\n\n* I think the pricing isn't bad, though I'd be happier if either the videos _were_ full DVD quality or the cost came down by a buck or two. The season finale of _Battlestar Galactica_ is about as long as _Grosse Pointe Blank_, it's only \$1.99 and I shouldn't have to tell you which one I consider to be a more important work of modern cinema.\n\n    Of course, the \$9.99 price point for movies is the same as iTunes's \"official\" price point for music albums, so the pricing for \"library\" movie titles is consistent not only with the iTunes Store but with the world at large, where DVDs are usually similarly priced to CDs.\n\n\tEven the screwy \"new release\" pricing has a certain iTunesesque consistency to it, as a _lot_ of new/recent albums on the Music Store have lately been selling for \$11.99, then coming down to \$9.99 after a few weeks of release. The biggest change for movies is that they're the only content on the store that actually goes _up_ in price after a week, and there's no clear indication yet as to how, when and by whom the decision is made to move a given movie from \"new releases\" (\$15) to \"library\" (\$10) status.\n\t\n\tMy best guess is that it's tied to the DVD release: the first _Pirates of the Caribbean_ movie is a \$10 \"library\" title, and sure enough the _Pirates_ DVD has started appearing on the bargain DVD racks at Best Buy and Virgin. Whereas _The Incredibles_ -- which is still considered a \"new release\" even though the DVD's been out for 18 months -- is still selling for a more typical \$15-20 at many stores. So maybe when the DVD comes down in price, so will the iTunes version.\n\n* Oh, by the way: I have one of those 5-megabit broadband connections Jobs mentioned in his presentation, and downloading a feature film takes about 60 minutes for me, not 30.\n\n* 640&times;480 is, in my opinion, a decent size for the price. Any smaller and it definitely _would_ be a rip-off; any larger and a movie would take six months to download. It's a good compromise for right now, and I'm sure Apple will work to improve the quality in the future. (And I'm sure when that happens I'll be just as miffed as I am right now about all the TV shows I bought from them last season being in the old, low-res format.)"

    body: "You may have noticed that until today, the last time this blog was updated was sometime back in July. I don't know if that's the longest I've gone between posts here on _Practicalmadness_ but it's certainly one of my longer quiet intervals. And while this one hasn't been _entirely_ quiet -- the \"Recommended\" sideblog has gotten regular updates all summer long -- the blog here has certainly been a casualty of my recent, overworked lifestyle.\n\nSince April I've been working both at my day job and as an independent contractor on a variety of odd web development jobs. I've been making lots of money -- and managed to move myself into a rather fabulous Bucktown apartment a few weeks ago -- but I've had virtually no time for blogging, or for that matter sleep.\n\nWhen I started taking on these consulting contracts I told myself there would probably come a time when I would have to choose one job or the other. I mean, not only is it the surest way to burn myself out right when my clients need me to stay sharp, but it's also unnecessary. My side job, even in the leftover hours from my day job and that pesky sleep thing, earns me a living wage. I've had to turn away clients and jobs all summer that could have brought in some serious cash because I'm already working at my capacity.\n\nWell, that era is coming to an end: starting on November 1 my web consulting business will be my one and only job. I've got my first round of projects either locked in or in final negotiations, as well as some smaller gigs I'll be doing to make some extra cash and help out some buddies, and enough cash in the bank to get me at least until the end of January.\n\nIn addition to the fact that I'll be able to multitask working on websites with watching _The West Wing_ in my underwear all day, I'll be more free to talk to clients during business hours. I'll even be able to make it to the Chicago.rb meetings and network with some of my fellow Windy City Rails nerds.\n\nAnd I'll get to sit in my new Aeron chair. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this chair. The chair at my current office isn't so uncomfortable, but does some bizarre voodoo number on the nerves in my back that make my entire right leg go stiff and cranky.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I'll be in a position to choose projects I'll enjoy working on and will be well suited for. My current clients are all great folks I enjoy working with very much, and I'm looking forward to expanding my business over the coming months.\n\nSo to bring this thing back around: I had planned a big _Practicalmadness_ relaunch for next week (including a new Rails-powered CMS, finally replacing Movable Type), but I'm nowhere near ready to go ahead with that. However, I _have_ finished the code for the new site that imports old entries, so I'm going to resume updating here as much as possible between now and Halloween, after which you better _watch out_ for all the crazy new content. (Did you really think I'd let a week go by without commenting on a new version of iTunes? Tsk, tsk.)\n\nAnd all you Rails folks out there: I'm about 80% sure I'll be starting a separate blog (as part of the main site) focusing exclusively on Ruby on Rails and related matters. Stay tuned for details.\n\nFinally, while I've probably got November and maybe December booked, if anyone out there on the series-of-tubes-ernet needs some freelance/contract Rails help during those months please do give me a holler at <david@practicalmadness.net>."

    body: "[Howard Zinn posits -- on the fourth of July, no less -- that flag-worship is \"one of the great evils of our time, along with racism, along with religious hatred.\"](http://progressive.org/mag_zj2205) I find it hard to agree with Zinn when he's essentially saying that waving a flag and eating barbecued pig in celebration of one's country is on the same spectrum of \"arrogant nationalism\" as that which led to genocide against Native Americans, not to mention the Bush administration's foreign policy. It's a morally simplistic -- even regressive -- argument he's making.\n\nTake this quote:\n\n> National spirit can be benign in a country that is small and lacking both in military power and a hunger for expansion (Switzerland, Norway, Costa Rica and many more). But in a nation like ours -- huge, possessing thousands of weapons of mass destruction -- what might have been harmless pride becomes an arrogant nationalism dangerous to others and to ourselves.\n\nI'll admit that I feel a little weird making this argument, but here goes: at what point does a nation become sufficiently militarily strong that its citizens should stop taking pride in it? France used to be the greatest military power in the world -- is Zinn saying that during that era it was morally reprehensible to have been proud to be French? And is he saying that such obligation to disassociate oneself from their national identity begins and ends with their nation's military primacy, or is he saying that it's okay to feel good about your country so long as it can't blow a motherfucker up?\n\nOf course, if we were to ask Zinn that question, he'd likely point out that when the French ruled the world, most of the French were subjects, not citizens, and weren't so much engaged with the political process as they were victimized by it. And therefore, those generations of French men and women can't very well be held accountable for the actions of their government. Whereas America, since its founding, has been a nation by and for its people, and by that token its people must be held accountable for their nation's myriad sins.\n\nThere's a degree to which Zinn has a point: on July 4 we celebrate all the good stuff about America's 230 years of independence from England while conveniently ignoring an awful lot of bad stuff. Yes, Americans in their time have been cruel, even inhuman, toward Native Americans, blacks, the Japanese, Vietnamese, Iraqis, El Salvadorans, and many, many, many more people. I really don't have an argument to counter-balance the fact that our country has done some evil things in the last 230 years, or that we continue to do them in Iraq, at Guantanamo Bay, in the rumored \"black sites\" in Europe, not to mention right here at home.\n\nThe real sticky question is: when we wave a flag are we celebrating America's ability to impose its imperial will on other nations, or are we celebrating the American ideal -- of a peaceful, self-determining nation of free people?\n\nJust as it's morally simplistic to say that the American experiment has failed, it's equally naive to say that the experiment has _ended_: yes, we're killing Iraqis and that's got to stop, and I can't say I don't believe that anyone who voted to give President Bush a second term has a little bit of complicity in the wholesale disaster that is the War on Terror. It's not like I believe those Bush voters are going to Hell for pulling a different lever than I did two years ago, but rather that they let their idealism get the best of them.\n\nBush showed them a vision of America that _is_ simplistic, where America _does_ stand for bringing peace by threatening war, where Islamic extremism is a menace and American values are an absolute good. Basically he promised us the glory of Rome, and 50.1% of voters thought the glory of Rome sounded pretty good without also considering that while it must have been pretty nice to be Rome, it wasn't necessarily as good to be _a Roman._ But I can see how it's easy, in a nation ostensibly by and for its people, to confuse the two.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: I'm not sure it's any less arrogant to condemn people for confusing the greatness of _America_ with the greatness of _being American._ There are lots of good things about being American. While we haven't eradicated the legacies of racism, sexism and poverty, we've come an awfully long way towards that goal because Americans are committed problem-solvers.\n\nAmericans are disproportionately rich, and many of us bitch and moan about having to pay the taxes that help support the less disproportionately rich among us. That being said, if the rich are categorically opposed to helping their fellow humans, how do you explain the two richest men in the world -- Bill Gates and Warren Buffett -- teaming up to endow the Gates Foundation with huge amounts of cash with the mandate that it be used not just to band-aid problems with money but to find _real_ solutions to some of the world's greatest problems? \n\nThere's something distinctly American about the idea that poverty and disease, while daunting, are _solvable problems_. It's the same spirit that took us into space and to the moon: because we're a strong nation, and because this is a thing we can do for all mankind. America didn't send Apollo 11 to the moon to colonize it -- we sent it there because we were the nation that could land a man on the moon, and while doing so certainly says that America is powerful, it also says that _humanity_ is powerful.\n\nAmericans decided that to go beyond the sky and touch something that in our very recent past was unimaginably distant was a _solvable problem_. There were other ways to demonstrate our military might to the Russians: for example, we could have blown up their space program with a nuclear weapon. But instead we decided to engage them in a (relatively) friendly competition to see who could do the impossible first. That's the American spirit, that can-do, go-ahead drive to make a better world. We've made some terrible mistakes in our history, and I cannot disagree that someone who waves a flag to salute the murder of other cultures in the name of American military might is a deplorable asshole.\n\nBut as much as I sometimes want to wash my hands of _America_ and find a nice little place to live in Canada or Europe or Australia, sometimes I can't but shake my head in wonder at the amazing things _Americans_ can come up with. And I can wave a flag in the hope that one day we'll be able to say we've solved more problems than we've caused."

    title: "Fun With TextMate and Amazon S3"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " I finally took a moment to play around with the Amazon S3 mass storage web service over the weekend, and all I can say is: that&#8217;s it? It&#8217;s that easy to work with? Holy shit! Amazon S3, if you..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/images/2006/07/105694980_9fa7e0be40.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />\n\nI finally took a moment to play around with the [Amazon S3](http://s3.amazonaws.com/) mass storage web service over the weekend, and all I can say is: that's _it?_ It's _that_ easy to work with? Holy shit!\n\nAmazon S3, if you weren't aware, is an amazing product that gives you massive amounts of highly reliable storage for almost no money. If in a given month you need less than a gigabyte of storage, and push less than a gigabyte of traffic, the total monthly cost for S3 is less than _one dollar._ There is no minimum charge, and you don't have to ever sign a contract or sign up for a monthly plan. They link your S3 account to your Amazon.com account, you choose what credit card you want to have billed, and that's it.\n\nAnd once you've uploaded your data to S3, it can be made available to the public via the web. The advantage of using S3 instead of your own server is that your data is hosted on Amazon's servers, which are many hundreds of times more reliable and robust than my \$12/month shared server at TextDrive. The best part so far: you can point your own domain name to your Amazon S3 account, provided you create a \"bucket\" with that domain name. To wit: I want to serve files at `assets.practicalmadness.net,` so I created a bucket by that name and created a domain alias from that domain to `s3.amazonaws.com`. Voila -- it works right away.\n\nSo S3's pretty exciting, but there's a huge catch: unlike an end user storage app like Photobucket or Strongspace, S3 is strictly a web service, not a web application, meaning that there is no flashy website where you can manage your files or share them with your friends. The only way to get data into or out of S3 is to track down (or write) software that can speak its language.\n\nThe newest version of Interarchy (a Mac-only file transfer client) supports S3, and I could certainly use that to handle all my file-transferring needs, but I had an even better idea. Amazon released a Ruby library for S3, and as it happens the TextMate Blogging bundle I've been using for a couple of weeks to update my site is largely written in Ruby. So I got to thinking: how difficult would it be to rewire the file upload code in that blogging plugin to use my S3 storage space instead of my web server?\n\nSo I started hacking away, and twenty minutes later I had TextMate and S3 talking like old friends. Now whenever I drag and drop a JPEG, GIF or PNG image onto a blog post it's automatically uploaded to S3 and a link to the image is inserted into the text.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://assets.practicalmadness.net/images/2006/07/Picture-11.png\" /></p>\n\nI'm seriously impressed, and now I'm wondering what _else_ can be accomplished with this wonderful new toy. <del>(By the way, if you'd like me to post up my hacked TextMate bundle just leave a note in the comments.)</del>\n\n**Update:** Here's my [patched copy of the Blogging bundle](http://assets.practicalmadness.net/Blogging.tmbundle.zip) (148 KB Zip file). This differs from the original Blogging bundle by Brad Choate in the following ways:\n\n* Images are uploaded to Amazon S3 instead of your weblog server. Make sure to open the bundle in TextMate after you install it, find the file `Blogging.tmbundle/support/lib/s3_settings.yml` and add your access keys and bucket name. You can even set which domain should be used for the image URL (if it's not `yourbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`).\n\n* You are _always_ prompted for a filename before the file is uploaded. I changed this because a lot of the time I'll upload a screenshot with a name like Picture 2.png, and I'll want to rename it on the fly.\n\n* Another thing about naming: I prefer to have a dated path for my images (in a form similar to `images/YYYY/MM/filename.ext`), so this version automatically generates one. This and the endless prompting for the filename can be disabled by tweaking the code in `blogging.rb`.\n\nAnd one other thing: this is my first venture into dealing with a TextMate bundle, so it's certainly possible that some things could have been done better or could leverage TM's awesomeness more than I have here. Really, all I've done is drop in maybe five or six lines of easy code to replace five or six other lines of easy code. So what I mean to say is: if you've got some ideas for how to improve this even further, please do investigate and do let me know what you come up with."

Whether a file is handled as an enclosure (e.g., for a podcast) is rather dependent on your blogging system.\n\nThe simplest and most elegant way to handle podcasts would be to extend the Blogging bundle's drag-and-drop feature to upload media files (say, those ending in .mp3, .mp4, .m4a, .m4v and .mov) and insert them into your post as a link with the `rel=enclosure` attribute. And I sometimes post Zip or PDF files, so those would be good ones to include as well."

    body: "Yesterday I embarked on a new project: to learn to love vegetables, or perish in the attempt. See, I'm a meat and potatoes kinda guy. And candy. And potato chips. And prosciutto. And cheddar cheese. Generally the things I eat day to day are what dieticians might call \"bad for you,\" and now that I'm no longer spending all day walking a retail floor or schlepping back and forth between places on foot as much, it's taking a toll.\n\nI'm not talking (exclusively) about weight gain, although I'll confess that I'm feeling inordinately self-conscious about my image lately. ([Having to speak in front of a few hundred people last week](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/06/railsconf_day_1) is probably at least part of that.) When you eat nothing but fatty protein and sugar, and very little in the way of fiber and roughage, there are some rather unpleasant gastrointestinal consequences. Were I to supplement my daily power-bar habit with even _one_ serving of broccoli or celery or what have you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\nAnd now that it's summertime it's just _unpleasant_ to eat a lot of rich food in quantity. I hate being the heat and humidity enough already without having to go through it all gassy and near-nauseous. Let me ask you: on a warm summer afternoon what sounds more delicious than a sack of [Rainier cherries](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/28676_rainier23.shtml) from the overpriced market down the street?\n\nSo both yesterday and today I've ordered a salad at [Jerry's](http://jerryssandwiches.com) instead of sandwich. The template for a Jerry's salad is quite simple: some meat and/or vegetables (yesterday it was steak and grilled asparagus, today blackened chicken and roasted peppers) served over a bed of raw red onions and mixed salad greens. On the side there may be cheese, or not, depending on my mood. And there is _always_ a tiny cup of balsamic vinegar.\n\nI've even developed a salad strategy: \n\nFirst, I pick at the meat. I'm allowed to do this, I've decided, because I'm going to eat all the greens separately (more on this in a moment), and because this is what I'd be doing anyway had I ordered the sandwich version and discovered that the bread was too stale, too slathered in whatever crazy sauce, or just not what I feel like eating.\n\nThen, if appropriate, I begin picking at the vegetables. Today I was pairing the yellow peppers and onion with pieces of chicken, which is _delicious_. The important thing here is that _nothing_ else is involved: no bread, no greens, no sauce -- nothing but the spicy chicken and the sweet peppers. Deliciously simple.\n\nNote that up to this point there has been no mention of that little cup of balsamic. That's for good reason. You see, Jerry's has a great balsamic which is tragically allowed to sit and separate in the store _long_ before I let it sit and separate. And while I think balsamic is a great flavor pairing with the greens, onions and (often) vegetables, it's just not all that great with sandwich meat. And dressed mixed greens are just easier to eat if you don't have to deal with the protein. Note that my usage pattern here is due in part to the weak-ass plastic fork I'm forced to use; were I more willing to dirty a proper fork at lunchtime I might be inclined to change my process.\n\nSo for the third and final phase of salad-eating: I dress the greens, toss them, and eat them.\n\nHere's the important thing: each individual stage of my salad has a different texture and flavor profile. The idea behind most salads is that you should mix all the stuff together and shovel huge forkfuls of (in yesterday's case) steak, brie, onions, asparagus and salad greens into your mouth, all slathered in balsamic or some other dressing. To me that just seems like way too many flavors going on at once.\n\nSure, there are many salads that are designed to provide a harmony of flavors and textures, where each ingredient plays off the others to contribute to something greater than the sum of its parts. That salad definitely exists -- they just don't make it within walking distance of my office. \n\nAnd sure, this may seem like insignificant news, especially when I could be telling you about the websites I designed today or the fact that I wrote my first proper Rails plugin over lunch.\n\nBut hey -- David Demaree is eating salad. Stop the presses."

    title: "Tagging in Movable Type 3.3"

    body: "I'm currently rolling fast and loose on this site, having installed the [beta release of Movable Type 3.3](http://sixapart.com/movabletype/beta) last week. The biggest change from my viewpoint is the addition of native tag support. Since earlier this year I've been using the `MT-Tags` plugin to handle tagging on Practicalmadness, which involved using the Keywords field to automatically spawn a bunch of Categories in a very tag-like way. The new Tags feature eliminates the need for this, but creates a few new issues in the process.\n\nWhereas before \"tagging\" was just a rather agile interface to the existing Categories feature, a Tag is now a completely new organizational construct. Previously a post could belong to zero or more categories (which I was calling tags). Now it can belong to any of those categories _as well as_ zero or more tags.\n\nThis means that my investment in categorizing posts is now more or less wasted, and because MT helpfully converted all my tag-categories into real tags on upgrade, I've now got a whole bunch of useless singleton categories, just because I happened to list something other than one of my 4-5 \"core\" categories first when I was tagging an entry.\n\nHowever, that's not the end of the world, as I can just go through and fix up my templates to use the Tag construct instead of Categories, and we'll be 100% okay. Sure, the template tags for tagging are currently undocumented, but when has that ever stopped me from doing something cool?\n\nThe bigger aesthetic issue is this: browsing your entries by tag is now handled by MT's built-in search feature, and the URLs are atrociously ugly. Currently to browse a tag on this site you go to `http://practicalmadness.com/tag/TAG_NAME`. This is _really_ just a Category archive (since tags used to be just categories), which was perfect because it meant that \"tags\" could have their own archive page design and some lovely, usable URLs.\n\nNow we've got crap like this:\n\n![Movable Type 3.3's Tag search URL scheme sucks](http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/2006-06-26_Picture-3.png)\n\nMovable Type was never _really_ designed to be a dynamic publishing system. (\"Dynamic\" here means that pages are generated by the system when you ask for them, as opposed to a \"static\" model where pages are generated and cached to disk when I save the content.) Sure, a PHP-based dynamic option was introduced back in MT 3.0, but it's never really been more than a hack. MT itself has always been a Perl app that builds static web pages, and MT feels most _itself_ when you're working only with the original, static stuff.\n\nSince the earliest days, to get clean URIs (like `/entry/202/some_stuff`, and as opposed to `entry.php?id=202&view=html`) with MT required some `.htaccess` trickery and liberal use of the Archive File Templates feature that lets you customize where files are saved to disk. Now I've got to figure out how to fool the MT-Search CGI script into believing it's got the information it needs, while passing it a URL like `/search/tags/Ruby%20on%20Rails`. Which is really, truly more hacking than I'd prefer to do to get a \$69.95 piece of commercial software to do what I want.\n\n![Hacking MT's tag search URLs](http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/2006-06-26_Picture-4.png)\n\nAnd if I'm going to have to do that to deal with that CGI script, why not have _all_ my pages generated by a CGI script? And provide a standard way of passing pretty URLs to them?\n\nAnd finally, one other thing: MT's idea of what constitutes an entry still assumes that all entries are formatted the same way, and its cross-blog support is still unbelievably lame. If I want to show Recommended links inline with my posts, I've got to use three plugins and spend a day hacking everything together, and that's just for a straight chronological view on the homepage. I'm not sure if it's even possible to offer cross-blog tag search, while displaying each type of post in its own format, because the search CGI script assumes that all the entries follow the same structure.\n\nThat's really not a great assumption, and it gives me yet another reason to keep working on my Rails blogging app  so I can evolve this site beyond Movable Type's constraints. I don't need perfect flexibility, but to not be able to mix together two kinds of text-based post without having to force them into the same data format is just looking more and more unreasonable.\n\n\n## That Being Said..\n\nSince posting this entry earlier today I have:\n\n* Switched the tag listings on each individual entry page from the old way to the new way\n\n* Redone the [Tag Browser](/tags) (which is this site's excuse for a tag cloud) to use the built-in tag ranking rather than my previous hacked-together solution\n\n* Beautified the tag search URLs as described above; tags are now available at `/search/tags/TAG_NAME` and links throughout the site should reflect this format.\n\n* Styled the search results page to match the rest of the site.\n\nSo switching from MT-Tags to _real_ MT tags isn't the end of the world or anything -- it's a mild inconvenience, and I still think tags aren't going to help bring MT any closer to being modern, but at least I can say making the migration happen takes _hours_ rather than _many hours_, _days_ or _oh god help us_."

      body: "Were you using the MT-Tags plugin? That plugin was a hack to make the categories feature in MT 3.2 behave somewhat like tagging by automatically creating/assigning categories for each space-separated item in the Keywords field (which the plugin helpfully renamed 'Tags'). It also added a field to the `mt_category` table that kept track of which categories were \"tags\" and which were just categories. When I installed MT 3.3b2, these categories -- the ones flagged as \"tags\" -- were converted to real tags.\n\nBTW: I actually rather liked that \"tags\" were just categories with a tag-like input method -- it made assigning multiple categories easier and far more useful than it ever had been.\n\nHaving now used MT 3.3 for a little while, I can say that the new tags feature is decent, but I still prefer to use either Categories or Tags -- not both -- and so any category assignments I made prior to adding MT-Tags back in February are now more or less useless. (And the conversion was, shall we say, flawed. So even my taggings from February through June are pretty much punk'd.)"

    body: "![Railsconf Talk Slides](http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/2006-06-24_RailsConf-Talk-Slides.png)\n\nHere, as promised, is the PDF version of my RailsConf presentation, [\"Meanwhile, In The Rest of the World...\"](/assets/railsconf.pdf.zip) (1.9 MB Zip file). \n\nI've made a couple minor changes from the one I showed (which will be made available to conference attendees synched with audio of my lecture) in order to make the show a teensy bit clearer to people who are just reading the PDF. And of course, any questions, comments and snide remarks should be directed to <david@practicalmadness.com>.\n\t\nAlso, I found [this photo of my talk -- and the huge audience -- on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kastner/174026040/) (thanks, kastner!):\n\n<img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/46/174026040_b35a09144c.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nFinally, I've started to get into using TextMate's amazing Blogging bundle -- which turns my favorite text-crunching monster editor into a fully featured blogging app -- to write and edit _Practicalmadness_.\n\nHowever, I've got a particular naming scheme for my images, and unlike [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit/) TextMate doesn't give me an option to specify the filename or path, and so images dropped into the window just end up uploaded to my server root. Not terribly cool. So here's what I did:\n\n* Found the Blogging.tmbundle folder (located for me in `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Pristine Copy/Bundles`)\n\n* Opened it in (what else) TextMate\n\n* Found `Blogging.tmbundle/lib/blogging.rb`, the Ruby script that actually makes the blogging magic happen\n\n* Found the `upload_image` method\n\n* Changed the string specifying the default image path from \"/filename\" to \"/images/YYYY/filename\".\n\nThere may be an easier way of setting this up, and if there is I'd love to hear about it. (And if there isn't, I'll see about setting one up. Maybe a prompt for the path/name? Anyone?)\n\nMore to come from RailsConf 2006 later tonight/tomorrow. Right now, however, there's a Chipotle burrito with my name on it. Mmmmm, spicy."

    body: "This isn't _everything_ that happened on Day 1 -- specifically I'm leaving out the part about finding _Battlestar Galactica_ toys at Target -- but here's a rough summary of my experience so far:\n\n\n## Thursday Night\n\nI went to the ThoughtWorks VIP reception and ended up chatting over beers with Stuart Halloway and Justin Gehtland. Now, I'm relatively new to the Rails community at large, so maybe this isn't news, but has anyone ever seen these two _apart_? I've been here for two nights and two days so far, and I've yet to see it. It's like The Stuart and Justin Show. Not that I'm knocking it: it's a terribly good show. (Tune in for our second installment, as Justin's Ajax on Rails talk was the opening act of my second day.)\n\n\n## Dave Thomas Keynote\n\nDave is sort of the father of Ruby in the English-speaking parts of the world, and authored the now-seminal _Agile Web Development with Rails_.\n\nAnd he urged the Rails community to \"please do investigate\" three major unsolved problems he sees as barriers to Rails gaining what the biz-heads would call \"critical mass in the enterprise space\" -- a baroque way of saying that Rails is having trouble breaking into the corporate market because it's really tuned to the needs of small teams or single developers who are also their own DBAs and server administrators.\n\nI won't go into the three problems or his suggested solutions, since every other nerd on the internets has done so by now. Instead I'll just express a concern. Dave Thomas is a _towering_ figure in the Ruby community, bigger than DHH and in some ways second only to Matz, Ruby's creator. There's a very strong tendency to accept his arguments, because he's been around longer and worked on a far broader range of projects than many of us ever will.\n\nBut is it possible that Dave Thomas can understand Rails without really \"getting\" Rails? His argument seemed to be that Rails needs to change to work in the enterprise, and not the other way around.\n\nIn his own keynote Martin Fowler -- who said he has never built a Rails app -- talked about how Rails is the right tool for a certain kind of application, and not (necessarily) right for other things, and that's great. You shouldn't expect to be able to build a great desktop app with Rails, just as you shouldn't expect toaster waffles to be as warm, flaky and delicious as real waffles. Why, then, should Rails be expected to evolve into something _less itself_ in order to be more appealing to some enterprise jerks?\n\nIt seemed to me like what Dave was saying is: Rails needs some features, and I don't know or care how to make them Rails-like, but that seems to be important to you guys. Hey, if anyone's got a brilliant idea as to how to make Rails work with existing, kludgy database designs or to work with any crazy old server configuration without sacrificing its unique beauty, that's fine.\n\nBut I'm not yet convinced that Rails can be made more versatile for enterprise applications without making it less usable for anything else.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that _Ruby_ doesn't have a place in the enterprise. Perhaps the answer is looser coupling between Rails and the Active Record library that handles its database stuff. Maybe what's needed is an \"Active Record for Enterprise\" that could be a drop-in replacement for the existing, artisanally-focused one.\n\n\n## Introduction to Capistrano (Mike Clark)\n\nThis one was completely mobbed when I got there, and I needed to give my slides a final go-through, so instead of attending I sat around the foyer with [Sam Stephenson](http://sam.conio.net/) instead.\n\n## Meanwhile, In The Rest of the World... (David Demaree)\n\nFrom my perspective my talk can be summed up in one word: terror. Want another word? Okay: _sheer terror._ This is my first conference appearance as a speaker anywhere, and I'll have to take the attendees' word for it that was okay, good, maybe even great.\n\nThe more important thing to say about it is: the reception of my talk has made me aware of a bit of a schism in the Rails community. A _lot_ of people here are Ruby nerds, and it seems that for these dudes this is like a bonus edition of RubyConf, with a strong interest in code, hacks and technical details of same.\n\nAnd then there's the other type -- my type -- who are more interested in the building of the whole widget, from code to design to usability to business to process. A hardcore programmer comes to the table interested in how the code does what it does, like a watchmaker interested in seeing how other people set up the gears. Someone on my side of that table -- perhaps best described as a glorified designer -- is far more concerned with how the watch looks, feels and operates on the customer's wrist. \n\nFor example, one guy who (without knowing I was in earshot) was slagging my talk complained that he thought it was going to be more about practical examples than the philisophical approach I ended up taking. That's a totally valid complaint, and I'm glad I introduced myself and talked to him, and the next time I give this talk or someone like it.\n\nIt's just a difference of approach: I spoke from the belief that I was speaking to some amazingly creative people whose answer to the question \"how?\" would be far better and more appropriate to their situation than mine, and instead should expand their awareness of the customer landscape. IN other words: I don't need to tell you how to walk through my country, but I ought to at least tell you where the land mines are.\n\n## Shared Rails Deployment (Geoffrey Grossenbach)\n\nGeoffrey writes the Nuby on Rails blog, and as a speaker this guy's got some game. That said, I can't say he said anything so extremely useful as his first tip, which was: \"Get a VPS.\"\n\nA VPS is roughly a nicer kind of shared web server. On a typical shared server, you've got one or more folders which are available to the public as web sites. On a VPS (Virtual Private Server) you've got your own virtualized machine -- your own copy of Linux, your own storage volume and root-level access to all of it. A VPS is _technically_ a shared server, in the sense that you're sharing your server's hardware with a certain number of other people. \n\nBut unlike what's typically called \"shared hosting\" -- the thing where you've got an account and some space on the server but don't control what software's installed on it -- it's very, very DIY. There are some VPS providers that provide a lot of pre-installed goodies and excellent customer support for them. And there are some that basically just give you a password and IP address with nary a \"good luck.\" Bottom line: hosting your site on a VPS requires either that you (or someone you employ) knows how to run a web server.\n\nSo while Geoffrey's other points -- don't even try to run [Typo](http://typosphere.org/) on shared hosting, write and run tests, try to clean out zombie processes once a day -- were all useful and valid, it's hard to say they were all _that_ useful when you consider that he _started his presentation_ by admitting that shared Rails hosting kinda doesn't work.\n\nNow then: there are some Rails-specific VPS and VPS-like products, like the just-launched [Rails Machine](http://railsmachine.com/) and TextDrive's still vaporous [RailsBase](http://railsbase.com/) that are intended to provide the benefits of a VPS (specifically better allocation of memory so apps/sites that require a certain amount of it are guaranteed to get it) with ease-of-use similar to (or better than) a traditional shared hosting situation.\n\nRails Machine's offering is the best I've seen so far in that they have a deployment gem that streamlines the process of staging your site, and they have an edge over TextDrive in that their Rails hosting offering actually, you know, exists in a form people can sign up for and use.\n\nBut just so you know: if you were hoping to set up your amazingly cool billion-dollar Rails startup on a \$8/month account at Dreamhost, you may want to take another look at a VPS provider like [RimuHosting](http://rimuhosting.com/). Or, you know, just try culinary school instead."

    title: "Google Spreadsheets: First Impressions"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Google's new web-based spreadsheet app is a simple alternative to Excel, with killer collaboration features and surprisingly few bugs."
    body: "[So Google does spreadsheets now.](http://spreadsheets.google.com/) This morning the new Google Spreadsheets launched in a limited test version; I requested an invite last night and got one this morning.\n\nThe basic idea is that it lets you create simple, shareable online spreadsheets through your browser. It's not nearly as powerful as Excel, but that's not the point. I would reckon that 90% of Excel users use maybe 10% of its feature set, and most often use it for stuff that could very easily be done with a word processor or notepad if it didn't need a calculation here or there.\n\nThat certainly describes the vast majority of my Excel usage, and I've been looking for a simple, cheap Excel alternative for quite a long time. It's not the expense of Microsoft Office I mind, mind you, nor do I find it to be particularly bad/cumbersome/ugly to use. It's just that Excel is a huge program that takes 20-30 seconds to start up even on my MacBook Pro, and usually when I'm starting Excel it's just to make a tiny change to a file.\n\nAnd as I do so, I have to put up with Excel's constant need to be more helpful than I want it to be:\n\n* \"It seems like you are making a list. Would you like to open the list manager?\"\n\n* \"There is an error in the formula you are entering. [Description of error, usually an un-closed parenthesis.] Would you like Excel to correct the formula or leave it alone for now?\" (This one usually comes up when I decide after I begin typing a formula that I want to enclose part of it in parentheses and start with the one on the right since that's closer to my cursor.)\n\nExcel for Mac is a lovely product -- I really can't imagine what I might want in a fully-fledged spreadsheet product that it lacks. But sometimes I really don't need a fully-fledged spreadsheet product as much as I need to make a quick change and have done with it. I'm not saying Google Spreadsheets (or any web-based spreadsheet) is that product, but that Google's approach here has a welcome simplicity.\n\nSince Google Spreadsheets is a web application, with remotely hosted sheets and workbooks, you get a couple of added benefits: live saving and easy sharing. Whenever you make a change to an existing spreadsheet it's saved instantly. You still have to click \"save\" when you're creating a new workbook, but after that it commits your changes as soon as you've made them. And if you're working on a project with a few other people, you can invite them to collaborate. I'm not entirely sure if this means everyone can see everyone else's changes in real time, but it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nAs one would expect, Spreadsheets hates Safari with a fiery vengeance, but works great with Firefox/Camino. So far it seems pretty solid: I had a couple instances where it would fail to re-render a spreadsheet and I'd be forced to reload the page, but for such a heavily dynamic web app on its first day of release that's pretty damned good."

    description: "Here's some of the random crap I've tried to write about this week before being distracted by something shiny."
    body: "Here's some of the random crap I've tried to write about this week before being distracted by something shiny:\n\n[Apple mysteriously dropped a new developer tool](http://digg.com/apple/Apple_accidently_releases_Dashcode_) this week. Dashcode is a total development environment for Dashboard widgets -- kind of a cross between Xcode (Apple's full-scale IDE for building Mac OS X apps) and iWeb (their rather less-than-full-scale iLife app for building web pages).\n\nEven though Dashboard widgets are little more than tiny, specialized web pages, I know next to nothing about building one. But now, thanks to Dashcode, I can make a basic countdown timer widget to let me know how much longer I'll have to wait for the Nintendo DS Lite to come out. And next I'll try to build a widget that actually does something interesting. (If by some chance you're interested in my little countdown widget, you can [download it here](http://practicalmadness.com/assets/ds_lite_widget.zip).)\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n\t<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/05/davids_first_widget.png\" />\n</p>\n\nThe smartest guys in the room are now the smartest felons in the room: [top Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling were found guilty](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5017298.stm) on several counts of fraud related to their company's total implosion in 2001. I wonder: how many variations on \"smartest (blank) in the (blank)\" have been permuted in the last 36 hours?\n\nI take pictures, did you know? I do, and I post the best of them to Flickr, such as [this set of recent Chicago pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/sets/72157594144937064/)."

    title: "NBC's Please See TV"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Maybe I'm too much of a snob to see it, but I just can't find the logic behind swapping the new Aaron Sorkin show out of a timeslot following \"The Office,\" and replacing it with \"Deal or No Deal.\""
    body: "Reacting to the fact that every other broadcast network except The CW is kicking its ass, [NBC has announced some revisions to the new primetime schedule](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/05/25/223473-nbc-revamps-its-week-old-fall-lineup) it announced last week. ([View the complete revised schedule here.](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/05/25/223481-nbcs-schedule-for-the-fall))  Just as the schedule as announced last week is the way things would be if the days of Must See TV had never ended and NBC just didn't have to worry about the competition, the revised schedule announced today is an acknowledgement of just how much the television landscape has changed.\n\nIn a perfect world, NBC would be perfectly able to pair its two high-end comedies -- _My Name is Earl_ and _The Office_ -- with Aaron Sorkin's new _Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip_, which would have been a great combination considering that the three shows probably share exactly the same audience of well-to-do educated white people. Unfortunately, that would have put the brand-new _Studio 60_ into direct conflict with _CSI_ on CBS and _Grey's Anatomy_ on ABC. So instead they're scheduling a second night of _Deal or No Deal_. I suppose they're thinking \"hey, at least if we fail we can fail cheaply.\"\n\nThis is an entirely practical move, but NBC runs the risk of playing it _too_ safe. By pitting only established shows against the heavy hitters on the other networks, at least they know that _someone_ will be watching. But while they're not likely to lose viewers, they're also less likely to gain new ones. _Studio 60_ is now the only highbrow comedy marooned on one of TV's weakest overall ratings nights, the same night that put the death blow to Fox's _Arrested Development_ last season. A certain number of Sorkin fans will follow him to Mondays, but it's unclear what that number is, or whether it's enough to save the show from a quick, ignominious cancellation.\n\nI'd go out on a limb and make a couple of assumptions about the audience for _Studio 60_:\n\n1. There's probably not as much overlap with _CSI_ (a conventional police procedural) and _Grey's Anatomy_ (a medical soap opera) as you might think.\n\n2. There probably is a great deal of overlap between the audiences for _Studio 60_ and the current Thursday shows _Earl_ and _Office_.\n\n3. Viewers of _The Office_ are much more likely not to keep watching NBC when the next show is an Aaron Sorkin comedy and not television's most idiotic game show.\n\n4. If I'm right that there's a certain overlap between the audiences for _Earl_, _Office_ and _Studio 60_, that means that there may be fewer viewers for those shows but also that they're higher-value. _The Office_ has lower ratings overall than some of the shows it's scheduled against it, but they're usually richer and better-educated than the people watching (say) _CSI_, making them much more valuable to advertisers, which means that NBC can charge more for commercials.\n\n5. And because _The Office_ is the awesome show that it is, with some of those well-to-do, educated people telling all their well-to-do, educated friends about this hilarious, wonderful show on NBC, it's possible that _The Office_ brings in viewers who otherwise wouldn't even be watching television. If there were a block of similarly great shows from 7 to 9 PM on Thursdays, who's to say that that wouldn't become a destination for people who are bored with 99% of what's on TV?\n\nI certainly don't mean to imply that _only_ snobs like me watch _The Office_; I'm just saying that given the choice between _The Office_, _CSI_ and not watching television at all, a large number of snobs choose _The Office_, and it makes NBC a lot of money. _Studio 60_, like the two Thursday comedies it would have been paired with, is probably going to be a niche show, as there's only so much walk-and-talk banter the average American TV viewer can stomach each week. But one niche show by itself is a challenge, while three of them together is a solid night of programming. If NBC had had _Arrested Development_ and been able to pair it with _My Name is Earl_ and _The Office_, that show would still be on the air today.\n\nSo if _any_ of the above precepts are true, it makes me wonder: exactly where is the audience for this second night of _Deal or No Deal_ coming from? What's the overlap between its audience and that of _Grey's Anatomy_ or _CSI_? And what's the likelihood that given the choice between those three shows or watching nothing at all, that more people will choose _Deal or No Deal_ than would have chosen _Studio 60_?\n\nIt's clear from this new schedule that NBC believes they know their audience. Specifically, that they know the audience they have for certain shows _right now_, and would rather bank on having some unimpressive yet solid shows in certain timeslots than risk embarassment by taking a risk on an untested show. But it seems to me that scheduling _Studio 60_ on Thursdays would have been the safer bet.\n\nBy moving it they're limiting their audience on Thursdays to existing _Deal or No Deal_ viewers (since I really don't see any new viewers going out of their way to watch it on Thursday) and placing _Studio 60_ at risk of either being ignored in the Fall or steamrollered in the Spring when _24_ comes back. Maybe I'm too much of a snob to see it, but I just can't find the logic."

    title: "MacBook Mania"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I won't bore you with the blah-blah details, but having just now seen the lil' MacBook in the flesh I thought I would weigh in with some impressions."
    body: "So I finally bought my [MacBook Pro](http://apple.com/macbookpro/) last Monday, and naturally, the smaller, blacker, non-pro [MacBook](http://apple.com/macbook/) was shipped to every Apple Store in creation on Tuesday. I won't bore you with the blah-blah details, but having just now seen the lil' MacBook in the flesh I thought I would weigh in with some impressions:\n\nThe MacBooks are _super-cute_: they're 13-inch widescreen laptops, and feel at once like a grown-up iBook and (in the case of the black one) a shrunken \"Wall Street\"-series PowerBook circa 1998. They're small without being tiny, which makes them perfect for the casual computer user.\n\nThat being said, the devil's in the details: the MacBooks feature an all-new keyboard design and are the first Apple laptops to have glossy screens. Glossy screens look nice on the sales floor and in the ads, and I'm sure a casual computer user who has no lighting sources in his or her home would have no problem with them. But as the word \"glossy\" might imply, there's quite a lot of glare. It's not a deal-breaker -- if you really needed to work in Final Cut or Photoshop using one of these, you could. But you wouldn't be thrilled about it, and a laptop is an awfully expensive, personal tool to not be thrilled about.\n\nI'm of two minds about the new keyboards: they're way, way better than the iBook keyboards that preceded them, but there's simply no comparison with the PowerBook/MBP keyboard. The MBP's keyboard is nice and responsive, and simply feels really elegant and usable, whereas I've taken to referring to the MacBook's keyboard as \"the Speak and Spell.\" It's not just that the keys are spongy-feeling -- they're also unusually low-slung and spaced out. I've tried them and they feel perfectly okay, just not great.\n\nFinally, the black one's casing smudges way, way too easily. I can imagine it looking very, very sexy for about thirty seconds. Sadly I have to imagine it because the less-than-one-week-old display models at the Apple Store are already smudgy, greasy and kinda unattractive. Which is a shame.\n\nThere is no technical difference between the two laptop families that would be noticeable to anyone but demanding pro users and the anal-retentive. The MacBook's screen is smaller, and it has an integrated graphics card (meaning that it's just a chip on the main system board that shares memory with everything else) whereas the MacBook Pro (MBP) has a separate, dedicated graphics card (a boss ATI Mobility Radeon) with its own memory and processor. This means that the MBP can handle video, advanced photo applications (i.e. manipulating 10+ megapixel RAW photos in Aperture with blinding speed) and 3D graphics with much more speed than the MacBook. That's not to say that the MacBook isn't great with graphics, only that the MBP is better.\n\nAllegedly the MacBooks and brand-new MBPs (as in, newer than Tuesday) have a new feature by which you can right-click by placing two fingers on the trackpad and clicking. I tried this in the store and couldn't get it to work, which probably just means it's turned off by default. It's a useful-sounding thing, and I hope Apple deigns to let those of us with eight-day-old Macs enjoy it soon."

    title: "Nintendo Knows How To Design For Humans"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "While Sony and Microsoft are fighting for the soul of the hard-core gamers and gadget nerds, Nintendo is working to make gaming easier and more fun for the masses. And to let me play Super Mario at three in the morning."
    body: "Some useful (no pun intended) lessons from a [feature story in the new issue of _Time_](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1191861,00.html) about Nintendo's upcoming [Wii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) video game console:\n\n> \"The one topic we've considered and debated at Nintendo for a very long time is, Why do people who don't play video games not play them?\" Iwata has been asking himself, and his employees, that question for the past five years. And what Iwata has noticed is something that most gamers have long ago forgotten: to nongamers, video games are really hard. ... The standard video-game controller is a kind of Siamese-twin affair, two joysticks fused together and studded with buttons, two triggers and a four-way toggle switch called a d-pad. In a game like Halo, players have to manipulate both joysticks simultaneously while working both triggers and pounding half a dozen buttons at the same time. The learning curve is steep.\n\n> That presents a problem of what engineers call interface design: How do you make it easier for players to tell the machine what they want it to do? \"During the past five years, we were always telling them we have to do something new, something very different,\" Miyamoto says (like Iwata, he speaks through an interpreter). \"And the game interface has to be the key. Without changing the interface we could not attract nongamers.\"\n\n> Nintendo has grasped two important notions that have eluded its competitors. The first is, Don't listen to your customers. The hard-core gaming community is extremely vocal...but if Nintendo kept listening to them, hard-core gamers would be the only audience it ever had. \"[Wii] was unimaginable for them,\" Iwata says. \"And because it was unimaginable, they could not say that they wanted it. If you are simply listening to requests from the customer, you can satisfy their needs, but you can never surprise them. Sony and Microsoft make daily-necessity kinds of things. They have to listen to the needs of the customers and try to comply with their requests. That kind of approach has been deeply ingrained in their minds.\"\n\n> And here's the second notion: Cutting-edge design has become more important than cutting-edge technology. There is a persistent belief among engineers that consumers want more power and more features. That is incorrect. Look at Apple's iPod, a device that didn't and doesn't do much more than the competition. It won because it's easier, and sexier, to use. In many ways, Nintendo is the Apple of the gaming world, and it's betting its future on the same wisdom.\n\nAbout a week ago I bought myself a [Nintendo DS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS). I like to play simple (as in, _Tetris_-simple) video games on the train, and I finally got bored enough with the solitaire game on my iPod to look at some alternatives. I was drawn to the DS the instant I saw three words on its package: _Mario Kart included_. I love _Super Mario Kart_. As well as _Super Mario All-Stars_, _Mega Man X_, _Donkey Kong Country_, _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_ -- all the great old games for the now-ancient Super NES we had when I was in middle school.\n\nI'm loving my DS precisely because it is everything the Xbox 360, PS2 and even the PSP are not: simple, tactile and easy as pie to use. I even love the fact that though the DS has Wi-Fi, it doesn't have built-in functions for checking e-mail or surfing the web. It does one thing really well -- it plays fun video games -- and is designed around the user, not a marketing campaign or a feature set.\n\nAnd I love the comment in the article about surprising customers. I think the greatest success and the most fun in the technology business comes when you offer people something they would never have expected or asked for. Like the [\"Virtual Console\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Console_%28Wii%29) feature planned for the Wii system coming out this fall: I could have expected a video game company to come out with some crazy high-def kill-em-all game I wouldn't want to play, or to make the controllers rumble so as to make the experience of getting killed by some horrible 3D creature more \"extreme.\" But I could never have imagined that a game system coming out in 2006 would let me indulge my crazy desire to play _Super Mario Bros. 3_ at three in the morning. Of course, it seems obvious in retrospect, but so does any truly great idea."

    description: "I was just thinking about this yesterday, and yes, I would say that it simply can't be right to kill a man for _wanting_ to have participated directly in the 9/11 attacks."
    body: "[From the Washington Post:](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050300324.html?nav=rss_email/components)\n\n> Al-Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui will spend the rest of his life in a maximum security prison for his role in the Sept. 11 attacks after a federal jury rejected the government's four-year quest to secure his execution for the deadliest terrorist strike on U.S. soil.\n\n> After weeks of listening to harrowing testimony from 9/11 family members, hearing heartbreaking emergency calls and watching painful footage of victims jumping to their deaths, the anonymous jury of nine men and three women methodically deliberated for 41 hours over seven days before reaching its verdict yesterday.\n\n> Jurors carefully went over each question on a 42-page verdict form that gave only a few clues to their thoughts and reasoning. In the end, though, the form indicated that prosecutors could not surmount the main obstacle hanging over their case from the start: Moussaoui did not hijack anything Sept. 11, 2001, because he was sitting in jail.\n\nI was just thinking about this yesterday, and yes, I would say that it simply can't be right to kill a man for _wanting_ to have participated directly in the 9/11 attacks. A truer civil libertarian than I might argue that even the life sentence handed down for Moussaoui's limited role in organizing 9/11 is harsh. But whatever -- the thing is done."

The text reads:\n\n> If you can talk brilliantly about a problem, it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered.\n\nThe wallpaper is available in a wide range of sizes, and you can have it in any color you like so long as it's gray.\n\nThe sizes:\n\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">800 &times; 600</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-1024.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">1024 &times; 768</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">1280 &times; 1024</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-1440.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">1440 &times; 900</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-1600.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">1600 &times; 1024</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-1680.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">1680 &times; 1050</a>\n* <a href=\"/wallpapers/kubrick/Kubrick-Wallpaper-Set.zip\">Complete Set (.zip file)</a>\n\nDon't know which one to choose? Well, both Macs and Windows PCs have a feature that can automatically scale an image to fit your screen, but the quality on that is not fantastic, and I want you to have a great Kubrick wallpaper experience, my friends. So here's the easy way to find out your display resolution:\n\n**On Windows**  \nRight-click on your desktop and select _Properties..._, then select the _Advanced_ tab.\n\n**On Mac OS X**  \nOpen System Preferences (in your /Applications folder) and select _Displays_.\n\nEnjoy, you deviated preverts."

    body: "The following quotation is taken verbatim from [this week's Harper's Weekly Review e-mail](http://harpers.org/WeeklyReview2006-04-11.html):\n\n> California legislators were considering a law that would make it a significant crime for a murderer to rape a victim's corpse; corpse rapists currently receive only 16 months of prison time for that portion of their crimes. Someone was mutilating\nand killing the dogs of Superior Township, Michigan, and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R., Tex.) announced that he would not run for reelection to Congress. \"I've\nnever done anything in my political career,\" said DeLay, \"for my own personal gain.\"\n\nThis quotation from [a blog post by David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000584.html) has been edited to remove references to [some geekery](http://www.rubyonrails.com) so as to render its sentiment more general and, yes, more mainstream:\n\n> First, ask yourself the question: do you really want to become mainstream? I'm not so sure I do. I believe that the mainstream is overrated.\n\n> To me, mainstream is mostly about reaching people who just don't care. There are certainly benefits to having such a broad reach that it can include people who don't care, but the downsides are at least as big. Especially in projects that we're primarily involved in to do something for ourselves."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "With all this talk of web-based photo galleries and novelty sodas, it occurs to me that I haven't taken a moment to really pimp my favorite computer platform recently. So let's take a rest from the other nine billion things this site routinely discusses and focus on what's truly important: stuff you can download for your Mac."
    body: "With all this talk of web-based photo galleries and novelty sodas, it occurs to me that I haven't taken a moment to really pimp my favorite computer platform recently. So let's take a rest from the other nine billion things this site routinely discusses and focus on what's truly important: shit you can download for your Mac.\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">'---------------'</p>\n\n\n**[NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), my preferred RSS reader for the Mac, is [back in beta](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php).** The upcoming 2.1 release is a Universal binary for Intel Macs, and adds a pretty exciting feature: synchronization with parent company NewsGator's web-based feed reader. This is great for people who use NetNewsWire with more than one Mac (say, at home and at the office).\n\n> After the first sync, subsequent syncs happen automatically, while refreshing feeds. (As opposed to NetNewsWire&rsquo;s .Mac/FTP syncing, NewsGator syncing happens in the background: it&rsquo;s much less obtrusive. No big modal dialog for your normal syncs.)\n\nVersion 2.0's .Mac syncing was only as speedy and reliable as .Mac, which is to say not very much at all. NewsGator syncing is everything .Mac syncing should have been: it's virtually transparent (whereas version 2.0 always had to spend up to sixty seconds at startup and shutdown communicating with .Mac) and seemingly way more reliable as measured by the number of times I get an error saying the service was unavailable. (That would be \"not at all yet\" for NewsGator, compared to \"three times is too many\" for .Mac.)\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">'---------------'</p>\n\n\n[**Pyro**](http://www.karppinen.fi/pyro/) is what its creators call a \"site-specific browser\" -- it's **a mini-browser designed specifically for 37signals's [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/) chat service.** It monitors all the rooms you're in, and whenever you get a new message it bounces its dock icon. Pyro doesn't have tabbed browsing of its own; instead they've fully embraced the philosophy of Less and are using some scripty tricks to improve the usefulness of Campfire's own tabbed interface. For example, the number of unread messages for a room is displayed next to the room name in its tab.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.karppinen.fi/pyro/images/pyroscreen.png\" alt=\"Pyro screenshot\" title=\"\" /></p>\n\nVery, very cool, but not without some limitations: Pyro can only connect to one Campfire account at a time, and currently offers no options for customizing its new message notification. For example, I'd love to keep the number of unread messages on Pyro's dock icon but _not_ bounce it, and to be able to use my own sound instead of the default system grunt. Also: Pyro is for Tiger only, so if you're the lone Tiger user in a mixed Panther-Tiger environment you may find yourself alone in your joy.\n\nBut hey -- this is a first release, and it's already making my life _so_ much easier. I had been keeping Camino open (even though Safari is my preferred browser) just for Campfire, because it can play the new message alert sound even for background tabs or when the window itself is minimized. This kinda worked, but Camino (like all Mozilla browsers, including Firefox) has some text-entry bugs that don't play nicely with certain Campfire features.\n\n<p align=\"center\">'---------------'</p>\n\nAnd finally, even as Apple Computer is facing Apple Corps in a London court over the use or misuse of the name \"Apple,\" it has been announced that someday [**soon one will be able to download the Beatles catalog from the iTunes Music Store**](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/beatles-catalog-to-be-offered-on-itunes-166976.php).\n\nWhich must make Steve Jobs so happy. Watch out Appleites -- he might just get so excited he'll release an iPod in a _third entirely different color._ Like gray, even."

    title: "Your Own Personal Flickr"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "As if anyone ever needed any such thing, I'm developing a small, simple photo gallery application."
    body: "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/124907784/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/42/124907784_ee448b375c_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"190\" alt=\"Your Own Personal Flickr\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\" align=\"right\" /></a> As if anyone ever needed any such thing, I'm developing a small, simple photo gallery application. I started on it earlier this week, and wouldn't you know it, it's almost ready for its closeup. I'm calling it _Ando_, in honor of Japanese architect [Tadao Ando](http://www.pritzkerprize.com/andorel.htm) who designed my favorite gallery at the [Art Institute](http://www.artic.edu/) (and also as a shout-out to the Ruby programming language's Japanese lineage).\n\nRight now \"Ando\" handles the uploading, sorting and display of image files. (Specifically JPEG image files -- it's yet to be tested with any other kind.) I'm thinking of maybe expanding the project's scope to include many kinds of media, including text, audio and video, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. This would be an evolution of the [Blrb blogging project](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/blrb_better_lightweight_rails) I was talking about back in January -- the idea is that \"Ando\" could be a 'gallery' of sorts for all sorts of things, not just pictures, and would be designed to treat all the different sorts of things it can store as first-class citizens, rather than being a text blogging application that also does images and audio.\n\nMostly I'm focusing on the part of development I most love -- the design -- and filling things in as I come to them. At the very least, this is something I could definitely see myself using for a little photo gallery on this site, and I'm learning _a lot_ about Ruby on Rails. I'm almost ashamed to admit this, see, but I've never taken the time to learn how to handle file uploads in Rails. I didn't expect it to be hard, but the PHP equivalent to handling an incoming file and putting it where it goes on the server is not technically \"hard\" and I still dread it. I should have known that in Rails, writing the code to handle a file upload is about as easy as, well, anything else in Rails.\n\nThe progress I'm making on this project -- which, I'll go ahead and say right now, may never see the light of day as anything besides a fun diversion for me and maybe a new photos section here -- has emboldened me to try some new things. Like, should I try to use [Amazon S3](http://s3.amazonaws.com/)'s virtually unlimited file storage instead of the 2 GB I've got on _Practicalmadness_? Should I try some crazy new brand of folksonomy? Ooh! Ooh! How 'bout an API?\n\nAnd let me just say this: Sam Stephenson, you and your crazy moon RJS meta-language totally rock. If you click into that screenshot at the top of the entry you'll see a little checkbox marked \"Comments are allowed\". On a traditional web form you'd have to check or uncheck that box then click a 'Submit' button, which would refresh the page.\n\nBut I wanted something spiffier -- specifically, for an Ajax action to send the changed 'commentable' value back to the server and, once it was saved to the database, change the text label and hide or show the form. Why do I want to do it this way? Because I can. And with RJS it took me less than fifteen minutes to make happen.\n\nWell...okay: in actual fact, I spent over an hour on that. But mostly that time was spent fussing over how many pixels should come between the checkbox and the form. I'm a little bit OCD when it comes to my web forms, and that doesn't affect my point -- that the killer combo of Prototype, Rails and RJS makes adding complicated DHTML nonsense so easy that a developer on a deadline has time to do that _and_ fuss over some margins."

Basically, you can edit titles and descriptions the same way you can in Flickr, by just clicking on them. But that feature is dependent on the HTML tags being named the way I named them. \n\nI'll figure it out, though, because I've been jonesing for some blogging software that can do this, and I suspect you and I are not the only ones who'd be interested."

    title: "Thirsting Redux"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised. Then again, I may start vomiting blood. I'm going into this raspberry Dr. Pepper experience ready for anything."
    body: "I woke up ridiculously early this morning, so I decided to get an early start. I left the house at quarter-of-seven, came to the office, on the way stopping at the White Hen for some breakfast. And what should I find there but Coca-Cola Blak, the [coffee-infused cola beverage I was talking about a while back.](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/03/the_knowledge_for_thirst)\n\nI'm drinking it instead of coffee this morning, though I must say, the flavor is way closer to regular Coke. It's like a slightly sour, slightly coffee-like version of Coke. What's weird is: I notice the Coke flavor at first, and then the coffee flavor, but after that it's _a perfectly clean finish_. There's hardly any aftertaste at all, and what there is feels generic, even _engineered_.\n\nI finally got around to trying the [Manhattan Special coffee soda](http://www.manhattanspecial.com/products_pure_espresso.html) my friend James brought up for the Oscars, and without regard to whatever else I could say it most definitely tastes like carbonated espresso coming in, going down and for at least an hour after drinking it. I didn't care for it, but I can at least appreciate that its lineage can be traced to actual coffee, whereas this Coffee Coke is the obvious product of frankenflavors and mad soda science.\n\nNow, that being said, I am rather more enthusiastic about this coffee-flavored monster than I am about the other novelty soda I found and bought at the White Hen this morning: [Berries & Cream Dr. Pepper.](http://tgubbins.blogspot.com/2006/03/dr-pepper-berries-cream.html) I can't think of a single good thing about that combination, and so of course, I bought some so I can find out just how awful it can be. A quick spin around some beverage message boards (yes! there is such a thing!) would indicate that Dr. Pepper fans are excited about the new flavor, and I certainly consider myself a Dr. Pepper fan, so perhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nThen again, I may start vomiting blood. I'm going into this raspberry Dr. Pepper experience ready for anything."

    title: "Pink is the Color of the CTA's New Line"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Now that the winning name has been selected, it is that child West Side residents should be thinking of when they hear the robot voice tell them they're riding a Pink Line train to work every morning."
    body: "First, a little history: the CTA decided last month to try creating a \"new\" train line by bridging the Cermak branch of the Blue Line with the Lake Street branch of the Green Line via the Paulina Connector. And they announced that they would be holding a \"Name the Line\" essay contest for area schoolchildren to pick the new route's color.\n\nThe current lines (for you non-Chicagoans) are Red, Blue, Brown, Green, Orange, Purple and Yellow. The initial news reports of the \"new\" line suggested its color might be Silver, which would have been a worthy addition. And I thought \"Bronze Line\" had a nice ring to it.\n\nBut neither I nor the Chicago Tribune are area students, grades K-8, and it is not our place to decide what the new color should be -- the children alone enjoy the privilege to nominate names via their essays, and the winning child alone bears responsibility for whether Chicago thinks their suggested name is sweet or so, so, sour.\n\nAnd now that [the winning name has been selected](http://transitchicago.com/news/ctaandpress.wu?action=displayarticledetail&articleid=112209), it is _that child_ West Side residents should be thinking of when they hear the robot voice tell them they're riding _a Pink Line train_ to work every morning.\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 1.5em 0\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/03/pink_line_to_yer_mom.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"222\" width=\"375\" alt=\"pink_line_to_yer_mom.gif\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\nPink was chosen over Gold and Silver, and I have strong feelings about both of those colors. I think Silver Line would be a bitchin' name, for example, and (now that the new Yeah Yeah Yeahs album is out) singing \"Gold Line's gonna tell me where the light is...!\" would amuse me for all of ten minutes.\n\nThe _Tribune_ reports that many children chose pink, so there isn't (yet) a story about why a Pink Line would be at all relevant to the city or neighborhood, about what pink means to the winning child, anything like that. What we _do_ have to justify it is this:\n\n> \"Pink clearly works,\" CTA President Frank Kruesi said. \"What was really exciting to the board members, and also a lot of people writing the essays, is that it brings a smile to people's faces. That's not bad as a start for someone hopping on a train.\"\n\nWell, gee -- if making people smile is the best justification for a color choice, I'd like to suggest to the CTA board that we re-color the existing lines while we're at it. For example, why on earth should I take the Blue Line to work, when I could be traveling on the Periwinkle Line? And maybe the trip from downtown to Evanston would be less irritating if one were spending an hour on the Lavender Line before changing to a Mauve Line train at Howard, don't you think?"

But i would like to see silver used for what others are calling the proposed Gray Line.  (For those who may not be familiar, that proposal is for the CTA to take over the Metra Electric route -- a good idea imo -- and call it the Gray line -- which a certain tour bus co. might not like.) As for Gold, it is rather similar to Yellow, which the Skokie line is using.\n\n(For the record, though not a resident, when I visit Chicago the CTA is my main way around town.)"

      body: "Pink has been growing on me -- or rather, I've accepted that pink is the color and stopped bitching about it. A lot will depend on the precise shade of pink they choose for the signage and maps. We could easily end up with a horrible hot pink, because anything else wouldn't be distinguishable enough from the color that results when the reddish-purple color of the Purple Line fades in the sun.\n\nThe CTA taking over the Metra lines could work out, but could also be disastrous. The CTA is a generally good transit system, but it's seriously mismanaged, and the management's solution every year is to threaten massive service cuts to blackmail city and state government into giving it more money, which in 2005 (and 2004?) meant dipping into the state pension fund. No one really trusts the CTA's management, least of all the RTA (the regional transit body that runs Metra).\n\nSo yeah, while a single regional transit authority running all the trains might be a good idea and can work (e.g., Boston's T system), such a thing would require either a culture change or a regime change at the CTA."

    title: "Gadget Corner: Internet Phones, Tiny Dishwashers"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Some little bits of gadgety awesome."
    body: "*   I finally found and bought the new [Linksys CIT200 Skype phone](http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/linksys-cit200-skype-phone-verdict-loaded-130269.php), a cordless handset that connects to any Windows PC and hooks up to Skype's P2P telephony network to provide cheap calls to any phone in the world, and free calls to any fellow Skype user.\n\n\tThe call quality is decent, about the same as a cell phone. But for me the killer Skype feature is the price: calls to most telephone numbers in the First World are \$0.02/minute, prepaid, and calls to other Skype members are always free. You can reload your account online using your credit card or a PayPal account, and every now and then PayPal or Skype will offer free promotional minutes. The ability to receive normal phonecalls (called SkypeIn) costs about \$4/month and includes free voicemail.\n\n    Unlike other internet phone services like Vonage, Skype calls are routed via other users' connections (fun fact: the creators of Skype also created KaZaa) and this particular handset requires a PC with the Skype software installed. One can make Skype calls from their computer using a headset or microphone and save the cost of the handset, but that makes it difficult to use Skype to call for pizza while you're crashed on the couch.\n\n* [Apple just released a software update for the 5G and Nano iPods](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/03/29/149798-apple-releases-software-to-set-ipod-volume) that allows you to set a personal volume limit. Smart people have said that limiting one's headphone listening to no more than 60% volume and no more than 60 minutes per sitting helps prevent your eardrums from being liquefied, but that iPod touch wheel is a slippery bastard. The sixty minute limit is up to you, but at least this will help you help yourself in the volume department.\n\n* The [Equator CD 400 is a tiny dishwasher](http://www.goodcommonsense.net/codi.html) about the same size as a large microwave oven, large enough to wash about four place settings' worth of dishes, glassware and utensils in about 45 minutes.\n\n* Griffin has [announced the new iTalkPro](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/3/30/3393), a successor to their audio recording iPod accessory now compatible with the 5th generation (video) iPods. The old iPods could record audio with the help of microphone add-ons from Griffin or Belkin, but were limited to 8 kHz, mono WAV files that were only barely usable for voice memos. The new iPods, however, can record at full CD quality. The iTalkPro (which currently has neither a price nor a release date) is the first announced product that enables the new hi-fi recording feature."

    title: "Rails 1.1 Releases, And The Crowd Goes Wild"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Ruby on Rails 1.1, a rather lovely upgrade to your humble narrator's favorite web framework, just released today."
    body: "<img src=\"http://rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;\" align=\"right\" alt=\"\" /> [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) version 1.1, a rather lovely upgrade to [your humble narrator's favorite web framework](http://practicalmadness.com/tags/ruby_on_rails), just released today. Big ups to the Rails core team and everyone in the community who contributed to the release.\n\nTo everyone building a Rails app right now, your lives just got a whole lot cooler. I used one of the biggest new Rails 1.1 features, RJS templates, in this year's Oscars Game for the \"live\" scoreboard/winners display on Oscar Night, and we're relying heavily on the new polymorphic associations for a client project we're working on at Killswitch Collective.\n\nThe [announcement at the Rails blog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things) describes all the delicious new features and improvements, and a post by Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson on [37signals's Signal vs. Noise blog](http://37svn.com/) explains the ancestry of some [Rails 1.1 features that were extracted from recent/upcoming 37s products.](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/rails_11_loaded_with_37s_extractions.php)\n\nAnd elsewhere on the web:\n\n* 37signals developer and Rails Core member Jamis Buck explains [the new respond_to feature](http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/03/27/web-services-rails-style), which does for web service APIs what Rails 0.11 did for Ajax -- it makes adding an API almost as easy as not to.\n\n* Mike Clark describes [some lesser-known features and improvements in Rails 1.1](http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/03/28#Rails11)\n\n* Dan Benjamin, who wrote -- IMHO -- [the very best tutorial for getting Rails running on Mac OS X Tiger](http://hivelogic.com/articles/2005/12/01/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger), has a follow-up today on [updating your Rails to 1.1 on Mac OS X](http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/03/28/updating_to_rails_1_1_os_x).\n\n* [DreamHost botched their upgrade to Rails 1.1](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2006/03/29/behind-the-scenes-of-a-botched-ruby-on-rails-upgrade/) and had to roll back to version 1.0 while they work out the kinks. D'oh!\n\n* But what the kids really wanna know is: is it faster? Stefan Kaes has the facts and he's voting yes: [Rails 1.1 is up to 11% faster](http://railsexpress.de/blog/articles/2006/04/03/performance-related-changes-in-rails-1-1) under certain circumstances.\n\n* Speaking of that fine Mike Clark fellow, he's back with an introduction to [Running Your Rails App Headless](http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2006/04/04#HeadlessApp). See, in 1.1 they've not only added the new Integration Testing framework, they've exposed it to `script/console`, for easier and more powerful poking and prodding. Very cool."

    title: "Harold and the Purple Chicken"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Harold's Chicken is meant to be eaten slathered in hot sauce, but you can be sure that I'll be the jerk in line who wants the sauce on the side or not at all."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/haroldsbagtwo.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"200\" alt=\"\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 15px 15px\"/> The Sun-Times tells us that [Harold's Chicken Shack is opening a location in Wicker Park](http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-harolds22.html) later this month, and I predict that yuppies, hipsters, trixies and other assorted white folks from throughout the Near North Side will be flocking to the new store to try out Harolds' legendary fried chicken.\n\nSpecifically, they'll be going to _this one store_ out of the 50+ Harold's Chicken Shacks throughout Chicago. Why? Because it's the only one on the North Side. People not familiar with Chicago's racial geography may be wondering why, with so many Harold's stores strewn throughout the city, it's such a big deal that they're opening up for business anywhere north of Roosevelt Road, let alone in a hot hipster neighborhood like Wicker Park.\n\nLet us begin our examination with a brief quotation from the [Wikipedia entry for Harold's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold%27s\\_Chicken\\_Shack):\n\n> The character of Harold's developed primarily out of necessity. Harold Pierce, a black Chicago entrepreneur, founded the restaurant in the 1950s because the newly spreading larger fast food chains avoided African-American neighborhoods. In turn, Chicago's legal and social obstacles to black-owned businesses prevented Harold's from expanding into downtown or the North Side. Harold's became one of the few examples of a thriving fast food chain that was owned by and primarily served the black community.\n\nHarold's is a black thing, but more importantly, it's a South Side thing. On the North Side of Chicago, having few choices for cheap eats means _only_ having a McDonald's, a Dunkin' Donuts and usually a Starbucks. In Wicker Park near Milwaukee Avenue, where the new Harold's is opening up, there are dozens of sandwich shops, taco stands and coffeehouses.\n\nWhen I worked at Starbucks one of our nerdy white managers from the North Side was hanging around with one of our black baristas from the South Side, and this guy was asking this girl to take him to Harold's some time. That's because for this kid to go into a Harold's on the South Side and order some chicken just seemed a little inappropriate and awkward. There's an invisible boundary between the white and black neighborhoods, between the North Side and South Side, that is simply not crossed for something as petty as chicken.\n\nAnd yet for some people on the North Side, Harold's Chicken is like something out of myth: _on the South Side they have these places that make the best fried chicken on the planet, and they're_ everywhere. And it's also something that's distinctly Chicagoan, but not a Chicago clich&eacute; like deep dish pizza you have to eat with a knife and fork, or hot dogs with a whole garden salad on them.\n\nAnd of course, it's a way for me to demonstrate my own lack of assimilation into the whole Chicago thing. You see, even after seven years in this town, I still order my hot dogs 'ketchup only' and I still appreciate a good thin crust pizza. Harold's Chicken is meant to be eaten slathered in hot sauce, but you can be sure that I'll be the jerk in line who wants the sauce on the side or not at all.\n\n**Update:** Gapers Block reports that [the April 2 opening date originally cited in this post was a flight of fancy](http://www.gapersblock.com/news/archives/2006/04/index.php) on the part of the Chicago Sun-Times."

    title: "The Knowledge for Thirst"

    description: "I'm known for my love of novelty sodas."
    body: "I'm known for my love of novelty sodas. For my birthday in December, my girlfriend gave me the [Jones Soda Holiday Pack][1], though it could be argued that the gift wasn't even so much the sodas but the great time we all had being disgusted by them.\n\nWhen my friend James came up from St. Louis for the Oscars party weekend before last, she brought a six pack of novelty sodas. There were some old-timey regional varieties like [Moxie][moxie] and [Cheerwine][2] the latter of which is a childhood favorite from its tenure in certain Alabama supermarkets. There's [Cricket Cola][cricket], a green tea-infused soda I drink whenever I pick up a sandwich from Potbelly. And there's some crazy banana and espresso sodas to round out the pack. I'm like, _score, dude_.\n\nAnytime there's a crazy new beverage on the market, I'm the first one in line to try it. When [Pepsi Blue][pepsiblue] was announced in 2002, I was at 7-Eleven every day (alas, seriously, I was) so I could see what blueberry-flavored cola was like. Same thing with Dr. Pepper Red Fusion, Vanilla Coke, Coke C2, dnL, Mountain Dew MDX -- the list goes on. I even _actively sought out_ the [Budweiser energy drink B&#094;E][3] so I could sample it.\n\nSo when I just learned today that Coca-Cola is coming out with a new coffee-flavored cola, called [Coca-Cola Blak][4], I got a little excited. It's not that I believe a coffee-flavored Coke is going to be successful. In fact I assume that these sodas will fail, and feel that trying them is a way of getting in on something no one else knows about -- sort of like an early ticket to a new exhibit in the museum of corporate marketing blunders.\n\nAnd there's something exciting about an idea so terrifically bad as Pepsi Blue or B&#094;E. Budweiser by itself is bland, commodified Americana, so to see Anheuser-Busch put out a ginseng- and taurine-infused beer in a Red Bull can is like the branding equivalent to heroin chic. It's sexy _because_ it's been ruined.\n\n\n## Everything's Going To Be Indie Rock\n\nIn my Wikipedia research into the annals of failed beverages, I stumbled onto something I hadn't previously ever heard of: [OK Soda][5], a failed 1994 attempt by Coca-Cola to market an \"alternative\" soda to slackers, hipsters and other attractively edgy folks aged 18-35. To quote Wikipedia:\n\n> International market research done by The Coca-Cola Company in the late 1980s revealed that \"Coke\" was the second most recognizable word across all languages in the world. The first word was \"OK.\" [Coca-Cola Company marketing chief Sergio Zyman] decided to take advantage of this existing brand potential and created a soda with this name. He conceived of a counter-intuitive advertising campaign that intentionally targeted people who didn't like advertising. He predicted that the soda would be a huge success, and promised Goizueta that the soda would take at least 4% of the US beverage market.\n\nOK (which is also pig latin for Coke -- \"oke-cay\") was test-marketed in about twelve cities (including Austin, Boston, Portland and Seattle) for about seven months before it became apparent that the nation was simply not ready to countenance an alternative soda marketed by a massive corporation, unless of course the soda were tasty, which by all accounts it was not.\n\nThe thing that struck me about OK was that the marketing was seriously ahead of its time. The cans (one of which is pictured at right) featured art by Daniel Clowes and Charles Burns and exactly the sort of bold graphic design that's in style right now. The ad campaign (slogan: \"Everything is going to be OK\") included an 800-number that connected to a voicemail box, and people could leave messages with the understanding that they might be included in an OK Soda commercial -- which strikes me as a slightly creepier version of the photos on the Jones Soda bottles, or like [Post Secret][postsecret] adapted to audio and made to service a brand.\n\nOne such message that was included in an ad:\n\n> Ah, this is Pam H. from Newton, Massachusetts, and I resent you saying that everything is going to be O.K.

    description: "My hypothesis, which of course has yet to be fully formed or completely tested, is that it has been more than two weeks since this web site was last updated. However, more study is needed before we can say that with any certainty. After all, I don't think anyone predicted the breach of the levees."
    body: "The last update to this Practicalmadness weblog was on March 7. Now, I'm no [time expert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor\\_Who), but it would appear to me that today is March 23 -- which is a date more than two weeks _after_ March 7. My hypothesis, which of course has yet to be fully formed or completely tested, is that it has been more than two weeks since this web site was last updated. However, more study is needed before we can say that with any certainty. After all, I don't think anyone predicted the breach of the levees.\n\nSo what's up, blog? I'll tell you something that's new with me: I will be speaking at the [First-Ever International Rails Conference](http://www.railsconf.com/), to be held here in Chicago during the weekend of June 25.\n\n[My talk, titled \"Meanwhile, In The Rest of the World...\"](http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/85), will be about designing web applications for a general audience, and avoiding certain assumptions one makes when you assume that everyone on the planet knows how to use del.icio.us-style \"tags\" just because you and your nerdy friends do. My audience will be up to 500 [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) developers, and after I offend and insult them with my half-baked ideas about the user experience, you will find me carrying the Practicalmadness banner and fighting for truth, justice and the American way -- in the hotel bar.\n\nMeanwhile, on the rest of the internets:\n\n* [Some guy attended ShoWest and blogged about seeing the new Pixar movie](http://www.jimhillmedia.com/mb/articles/showarticle.php?ID=1890) [_Cars_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars\\_%28film%29). And I'm glad to see Pixar is continuing their grand tradition of recruiting [voice talent from public radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah\\_Vowell): we can look forward to hearing the _Car Talk_ guys playing the talking race car protagonist's sponsors in _Cars_. (As for me, I'm sorry, but they lost me at _talking race cars._ Even if they do look like [Micro Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines).)\n\n* The headline of the day on Newsvine: [Doherty Pleads Guilty Then Kicks Reporter](http://www.newsvine.com/\\_news/2006/03/23/143600-doherty-pleads-guilty-then-kicks-reporter). We refer here, of course, to Brit rocker Pete Doherty, who you may remember was a supporting character in the [Kate Moss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\\_Moss) cocaine scandal last year, and who reportedly [did heroin and crack cocaine during a recent interview with _Rolling Stone_](http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/doherty%20takes%20drugs%20in%20front%20of%20reporter\\_22\\_03\\_2006).\n\nYou may have noticed that I'm doing a _lot_ of Wikipedia linking of late. I am, in fact, doing a lot of Wikipedia _reading_ of late, because I can't think of any other website that is as likely as Wikipedia to have content about [Micro Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro\\_Machines), [Crystal Pepsi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal\\_Pepsi) _and_ the [political structure of the Iranian government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics\\_of\\_Iran), or whatever other thing I happen to be interested in this hour. This should not be taken as an endorsement of Wikipedia's accuracy, its mission or even of wikis in general. This should instead be understood by you, Reader, as an acknowledgement that any website with such a plethora of obscure pop culture nonsense is a website that I will read and enjoy."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Yes, I know -- it's another 'miscellany' post. I'm not sufficiently exercised about anything this morning to spend a few hundred words dissing or praising it, but I did want to mention a couple bits of awesome."
    body: "<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/109224218/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/109224218_357c03b011_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Plush Bunny Love\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" /></a>\n\nYes, I know -- it's another 'miscellany' post. I'm not sufficiently exercised about anything this morning to spend a few hundred words dissing or praising it, but I did want to mention a couple bits of awesome:\n\n* OMFG [_The Legend of Zelda_ turned 20 last month](http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3148112). And I _still_ have never finished it. I'm just, um, waiting for it to come out on video-game iPod. Which means, of course, that I'll have to wait for there to _be_ a video-game iPod.\n\n* [Ain't It Cool News](http://aintitcool.com/) contributor Drew McWeeny (aka Moriarty) just [reviewed the _Battlestar Galactica: Season 2.0_ DVD set on his blog](http://moriartylabs.typepad.com/moriartys_dvd_shelf/2006/03/battlestar_gala.html) and articulated rather well the reasons why it's possibly The Best Show on Television:\n\n    > I would call this the first great post-9/11 television show.  I know RESCUE ME (a show I admire in its own right) deals overtly with life in the shadow of 9/11, but sometimes, it's better when you don't deal with something head-on.  GALACTICA uses the remove of science-fiction to pose real ethical questions about the way we live now.  No matter what culture you're part of at the moment, no matter what country you live in, no matter what your background is, there's a sense right now that we are in the last moments of the countdown clock, that things are going to get worse before they get better... if they get better.  It's like we've got survivor's guilt on a global scale, and this show taps that fear in a very real and potent fashion.\n\n* Just out in record shops, megastores and iTunes Music Emporia: [Neko Case's _Fox Confessor Brings The Flood_.](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=125337817&s=143441) (It's also available on everyone's favorite cheap-ass [indie-rock download service, eMusic](http://www.emusic.com/album/10902/10902121.html).) So far I'm not loving it as much as [_Blacklisted_](http://www.emusic.com/album/10857/10857848.html), which should not be taken as a bad thing -- _Fox Confessor_ is a different beast and will probably take some listens to fully get into. (I haven't really gotten into [_The Life Pursuit_](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/02/the_life_pursuit) yet for pretty much the same reason.)\n\n* MSNBC reports on a new computer model that [sex is less about genetic diversity](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11640233/), and more about isolating \"harmful mutations into individual organisms so they could be easily weeded out by natural selection.\" Which sounds sort of like trickle-down economics. But for sex.\n\n* I'm brewing a longer piece reviewing up some new web apps I'm liking: [StikiPad](http://stikipad.com/) is a nice little hosted wiki service that I'm probably going to use for the [Friendly PHP](http://friendlyphp.org/) documentation. [Newsvine](http://newsvine.com/) is an extremely ambitious attempt to combine citizen journalism (as in blogs), community-moderated links (as in Slashdot or Digg) and wire news (as in the Associated Press) into a one-stop shop for all things news. And [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com/people/ddemaree/) is like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/daviddemaree/), but prettier and more sodden with features (like TinyURL-style link shortening and star ratings).\n\n* Here are [some photos from this weekend's Oscar Night party at my house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/sets/72057594077002174/)."

    title: "Congratulations Oscars Game Winners!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Stay tuned for a full recap of the game, the Oscars and whatever else tomorrow morning."
    body: "Congratulations to \"Tony,\" winner of the 2006 Oscars Game with a dominating 612 points. Tony wins a 512 MB iPod shuffle and a custom Oscars Game t-shirt. Coming in second place was Andy Lund with 570 points, followed by Cheryly Syta with 540 points. Andy and Cheryly receive free stuff from the iTunes Music Store. Winners will be officially notified by e-mail Monday afternoon.\n\nAs for me, I came in at 18th place with 440 points, due in part to my abusing the new multiple pick sets feature -- the winners' superb performance was partly due to having made really good picks for the most difficult categories (documentaries and short films) and, in Tony's case, having only one pick set so that s/he didn't have to pay what I'm now calling the \"pick set tax.\" Final aggregate scores are divided by the number of pick sets you've created, so I managed to bleed 10-20 points on each category while Tony got to keep all the points (up to 36) for each correct pick.\n\nI'm eager to get some feedback from users about the pick sets feature, and it certainly made the game more interesting. Part of my intention in adding multiple picks was to reward certainty: if you're confident in your predictions then you only need one set. I was less confident, created three sets, and lost.\n\nOn the one hand I could say that I made riskier picks than I otherwise would have, and maybe if I'd had to limit myself to a single pick set I'd have been more thoughtful in my selections. On the other hand, I could consider myself lucky I got points at all for some of my selections. If I picked \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" for Cinematography in one set over the ASC Award winner \"Memoirs of a Geisha,\" I should have realized I was essentially throwing away ten points. And there were a lot of categories where I hedged and simply did not need to hedge.\n\nAs for the Oscar show itself: I say _meh_. The _Daily Show_ \"campaign ads\" for the various categories (narrated by Stephen Colbert) were a highlight, but Jon Stewart's performance as host was (as I said many times last evening) \"Ellen-caliber,\" though not nearly as bad as Letterman. The opening sequence was pretty funny, and he got a couple of good jokes in, but mostly it was all as lame and tired as, well, the Oscars. I guess we can't have Chris Rock every year.\n\nAnd the elephant in the middle of the room, \"Crash\" winning Best Picture? I'm shocked a little, disappointed a little and indifferent a lot. Not being in Hollywood, I can't say whether this represents some vast right-wing conspiracy to back away from the Big Gay Cowboy Movie, a bunch of L.A. provincialism (hey look! It's yet another movie about our town!) or what -- if I got to pick I'd have picked \"Capote\" or \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" so _whatever_, Hollywood. "

    title: "Perpetual Public Betas Are Totally Uncool"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "There is no such thing as 'finished' on the web, and there never was. Forgive me for saying so, but duh -- we all already knew that."
    body: "John Gruber (of [Joyent](http://joyent.com/) and [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) fame) just posted to his company's [Joyeur blog](http://joyeur.com/) about how [Public Betas Are A Sham](http://joyeur.com/2006/03/03/public-betas-are-a-sham). And now I'm engaged in a lovely comments thread argument with \"Boris\" that I just wanted to share with you:\n\n> **BORIS**    \nWe are going to be in beta for quite a while near the end of march. The good part about the web is that you actually have the freedom to stay in beta as long as you wish. If you develop hardware or produce printed media you know how incredibly frustrating it is to finally see your finished product and then finding a small error, misprint or bug.\nOn the web, your product is never finished. On the web, every day is beta day. Long live the web, long live the beta!\n\n> **DAVID**    \nBoris: I think Gruber&rsquo;s trying to say that what you&rsquo;re describing is a bad thing. True, a perpetual beta is great for developers, but it&rsquo;s terrible for customers since you&rsquo;re basically asking them to pony up cash (or to look at ads) for something you don&rsquo;t consider &ldquo;done&rdquo; enough to remove the beta label. &lsquo;Beta&rsquo; is a way of ducking responsibility.\n\n> **BORIS**    \nDavid: That might be what he means (and I understand) but it&rsquo;s not what he writes (and others might understand). True: asking cash for something that isn&rsquo;t finished isn&rsquo;t cool. But my point would be that there is no &lsquo;Finished&rsquo; on the web anymore. Therefore the term &lsquo;Beta&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t that bad after all.\n\nAnd it's at this point that I whip out the trusty word counter and open a can of epic-length on his ass:\n\nIt's true, there is no \"finished\" on the web -- there never was any such thing as a \"finished\" website. There is, however, such a thing as being \"done\" enough for the general public, which for me means a couple of things:\n\n* Basic features are present and accounted for. The more ambitious the app, the longer this list will be, but \"shipping\" software isn't missing anything really important. That's not to say that it has everything it should or could have, just the minimum list of features needed for people to get into using it.\n\n* Those features been tested and found to work consistently on current release versions of the Big Three browsers. (And you know what? A lack of Safari support needn't be a deal-breaker, so long as it's forthcoming. Us Mac users know where to find Firefox if your app is useful enough.)\n\n* The site is open for business. Signups (if needed) are being taken, and invite codes are only required if the normal, intended function of the app requires them.\n\n* The site scales so that whoever wants to use it can use it most of the time.\n\n* There's a help page, a contact form or just _some_ resource to help new users get acclimated.\n\nThere is no such thing as 'finished' on the web, and there never was. Forgive me for saying so, but duh -- we all already knew that. \"Shipping\" or \"beta\" are descriptors not of the state of the software (which will change constantly) but of the developers' confidence that it's ready for visitors. It's a state of mind, not a technological fact. The technological fact is that the difference between a 'beta' site and a 'shipping' one is often invisible to the end user, except that calling something 'beta' sets the expectation that it might break and calling something 'shipping' or 'version 1.0' sets the expectation that it might break but not as much.\n\nShipping means a product has been tested and found to be generally reliable. Shipping means it's supported by its maker to whatever extent they choose to support it. Shipping means accountability -- not necessarily in a practical sense, but definitely in terms of reputation. Shipping means you can ask for the consumer's confidence that your product is good.\n\nBeta is the absence of those things. Beta is not something to be aspired to -- it's a temporary state that should last as briefly as possible. _Of course_ websites evolve, _of course_ there's no such thing as finishing a website and having done with it. We all know that, and I'd assume your customers know that."

    title: "Presenting The New Site"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "However I may have improved the site in the last five years in terms of design skill, attractiveness, web standards compliance and Ajax gimmickry, and no matter how important or unimportant those things may in fact be, at least I can say the site is definitely more coherent now than it was then. And whether or not that is an improvement, Dear Reader, I leave to you. "
    body: "And welcome to the February Redesign.\n\n(Crickets chirp. The seconds tick by. A sense of comprehension so longed for, so craved in this vacuum of utter chaos we call human existence remains elusive. You cry to the heavens: _why? Why? Why, Lord, why?_)\n\n_Sigh_...you're wondering why the home page looks the same, aren't you? Well, you _are_ looking at the new site, on the new server, and while it was originally my intention to wait until I had all five main sections (home page, monthly archives, tag archives, individual entry pages and the new tags browser) in place before I unveiled anything, last night I impulsively decided that a big roll-out like that benefited nobody except my ego.\n\nSo here's what's new right now:\n\n* **The new [Tags Browser](/tags/):** I've been transitioning from assigning posts to individual categories (such as Web Arcana) to assigning one or more tags to the posts. The Tags Browser is displayed as a tag cloud (one of those things where tags with more items are displayed in darker, larger type than those with fewer items), and I've included some JavaScript trickery so you can filter the tags list based on how many entries are connected to that tag. (The list gets really, really short if the number is any higher than 3 or 4, but I still need to go into the archives and tag older posts.)\n\n* **Ajax-powered Commenting:** I _finally_ figured it out. Not that Ajaxed comments are really a necessity, but they're cool and they just make using the site a little nicer. This could still use a little bit of work -- specifically I'd like to add some kind of \"thinking...\" state so you know that the server's working on processing your comment, but this is good enough for government work.\n\n* **New Tags layout on the individual pages:** On the home page right now, tags alwayus link to a page on Technorati. Well, that's dumb -- Technorati's cool, but I'd rather you read _my_ stuff first. So on individual pages you've got the option. To look at the Practicalmadness tag, click on the tag name. To look at Technorati, click on the Technorati icon. To look at neither, just click on something else. Like your butt.\n\n* **The Plaid:** Gotta love the plaid.\n\nComing up next, I've got to apply the new layout to the other pages and work on making the archive pages a little cleaner and more useful. I'm not going to set a timetable for that, since I know I've got more important stuff to work on this week (_ahem ahem Oscars Game ahem_) and I won't stick to whatever timetable I set. I'm thinking next week until the realign is complete, which is totally fine with me.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of changes, I wanted to announce one more: provided I don't wimp out again, this will be the final \"what's new\" post to this site. I plan to establish a separate \"change-blog\" to announce design changes, new features and other stuff that would go into a post such as this one, because I'd like to keep the body of the site content focused on things not related to the site itself. It's like going to a party: if you spend the whole time talking about yourself, you're liable to end up talking _to_ yourself.\n\nI feel like sometimes this is a blog with an audience of one, talking about itself to itself, when talking about other things is much more fun for everyone involved. So this new \"Meta-blog\" will be up shortly, and I'm going through to remove old meta-posts as part of the process of reading through and tagging the archives.\n\nFinally, here's a blast from the past: the original Practicalmadness home page design from 2000-01, side by side with the February 2006 Redesign (click for a slightly larger version in PNG format, ~240 KiB):\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/02/practical_then_and_now.large.png\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'pmimg','width=830,height=325,scrollbars=no,toolbars=no,scrollable=no,statusbar=no'); return false;\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/02/practical_then_and_now.png\" alt=\"Practicalmadness home page comparison from March 2001 and March 2006\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n\nSo however I may have improved the site in the last five years in terms of design skill, attractiveness, web standards compliance and Ajax gimmickry, and no matter how important or unimportant those things may in fact be, at least I can say the site is definitely more coherent now than it was then. And whether or not that is an improvement, Dear Reader, I leave to you. "

    body: "A couple of quick announcements, at the end of which you will be rewarded with a photograph of an insanely large bunny rabbit.\n\n* [Friendly, my simple framework for fast, easy PHP web devlopment](http://friendlyphp.org/), is officially on the loose. I've been developing and using Friendly since last June, and the only thing more exciting for me than how it's shaped up into quite a useful little tool in the last eight months is how much cooler it's going to become in the _next_ eight. If you program websites in PHP you owe it to yourself to give Friendly a look. (And you can start with this concise [Getting Started](http://friendlyphp.org/docs/getting_started) guide I wrote.)\n\n* [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/), 37signals' new web chat application (that [I raved about earlier this week](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/02/kinda_like_a_web_chat_dj_battl)), is finally open to the public. And in case I failed to mention it earlier, no, Campfire is _not_ free. You can get a limited 30-day trial (for which you don't even have to enter a credit card number), and monthly subscriptions start at \$12.\n\n    Pricing is based on file storage and simultaneous users; for example, that \$12 plan gives you 10 users and 100 MB for real-time file sharing (in my opinion, Campfire's #1 coolest feature). I went ahead and signed up for the Plus membership, which gives you up to 20 users, 250 MB of storage and SSL security for \$24/month.\n\n   Congrats to the whole team over there for the launch, and for accomplishing the truly impossible: getting a beautifully-designed, cutting-edge web application to work seamlessly with Internet Explorer.\n\n\nFinally, since you made it this far, here is your giant bunny:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/02/1.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"750\" width=\"440\" alt=\"1.jpg\" /></p>\n\nMy _word_ that is a large bunny."

    title: "Kinda Like A Web Chat DJ Battle"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Sometimes in the testosterone- and caffeine-fueled world of the web geek, if it cannot rock, it must therefore suck. Which brings me to the latest tempest in a teapot: browser-based chat."
    body: "My birthday was also the day of the Snakes and Rubies discussion/event at DePaul, and later that evening at my birthday party as I was getting drunk enough to try dropping a discussion of web development frameworks into my otherwise innocuous cocktail chatter, I framed the event as \"kinda like a web frameworks DJ battle.\" [Sam](http://conio.net/) noted that the point of the event wasn't an us-versus-them, Ruby-vs-Python grudge match, and yet the crowd in attendence at S&R clearly _wanted_ a battle to pit Ruby's extreme dynamism against Python's extreme pragmatism, to put things in terms of us versus them. Sometimes in the testosterone- and caffeine-fueled world of the web geek, it's not enough to have found something you consider to be a superior solution -- you've got to have the validation of seeing the other side crumble under the power of your awesomeness. If it cannot rock, it must therefore suck.\n\nWhich brings me to the latest tempest in a teapot: browser-based chat. 37signals is due to release their new \"joint,\" Campfire, any day now. But last Monday Google added a web-based interface to Google Talk to Gmail, and so by the end of the business day that Monday there were asshats commenting at Signal vs. Noise about how Google had (a) beaten Campfire to market and that (b) this had something to do with anything."
    extended: "The problem with any comparison between Campfire and GTalk is that for all their similarities, they're solutions to two different problems.\n\nCampfire facilitates communication within a group of people: it's a chat room where co-workers can get together, swap ideas and share files. It's software for virtual meetings. The conversation itself becomes your whiteboard (and your meeting minutes, as transcripts are automatically saved), you can upload files in lieu of physical handouts and you can post links -- the entire Web becomes your PowerPoint. Last weekend I found myself _jonesing_ for Campfire as I was teaching a Dreamweaver class, just so I could post files in real time for my students to work on.\n\nGTalk, by contrast, is for classic, person-to-person IM. The intriguing aspect of Google Talk is not the OMFG factor of Google doing browser chat, but the way that they've set it up as just one way of accessing their already fairly open IM network. You can communicate via Google Talk using a wide variety of desktop apps, but now you don't even need to download anything. Just log into your Gmail account and go.\n\nThat freedom from downloading specialized software is a killer feature of both Campfire and Google Talk. I had an IM conversation yesterday with a friend who never uses IM, simply because her Gmail account got the chat feature and she saw me online. She didn't have to face any of the usual IM roadblocks ('Are we on the same chat network? Will this software download infect my computer with spyware?') -- she just clicked on my name and we talked. I was logged in via Adium, my favorite IM software for the Mac, and it didn't matter that I wasn't using a Google-developed piece of software or the chat feature of the Gmail website -- it just worked. Installing AIM or another IM product isn't exactly rocket science, but for ease of use nothing beats simply clicking a bookmark in your browser.\n\nAll that being said, if I _were_ going to attempt an apples-to-apples comparison between GTalk and Campfire, I might point out that Google's attempt to shoehorn an IM client into what I've so far considered the most elegantly designed e-mail application I've ever used is a little bit, well, dumb. I just don't like the presentation of IM conversations as smallish \"tabs\" pinned to the bottom of the window, that can be minimized like buttons on a Windows taskbar. And I'm really not liking how Gmail automatically includes anyone you've ever e-mailed more than once in the new Quick Contacts list, forcing one to explicitly remove a bunch of people or else risk permanently cluttering my once-pristine Gmail experience. That I don't like as much.\n\nGTalk simply tries to do too much with too little screen space, whereas Campfire is most impressive to me for the way it makes perfect use of the browser window. I've never been 100% passionate about the Backpack user interface theme (that's since been carried over to its sibling apps Writeboard and Basecamp). I mean, it's always been solid and usable, but it's always seemed _lopsided_ to me in a way that's left me cold. \n\nCampfire uses a very similar theme, but the 37signals crew has made great use of scrolling boxes and fixed-positioned elements. I simply love the _web-ness_ of it -- they've made something elegant and intuitive that doesn't waste a single pixel trying to pretend to be a desktop app, and instead just feels solid and comfortable in its skin. I've used Campfire a total of four or five times by now, and the interface is so intuitive that I feel like I've been using it for years. Chat in Gmail feels like a gimmick, while Campfire feels like a powerful tool.\n\nHowever, apples to apples or oranges to pineapples, there's one thing I thought of immediately after trying these two apps. Once upon a time, Microsoft was so afraid of an all-browsers-all-the-time future -- where the operating system you used was irrelevant so long as you had a solid web browser -- that they forced Netscape out of the business. As I started typing the phrase \"...so long as you have Firefox\" at some point during the writing of this essay, the irony made me smile."

    title: "Project Plaid"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I'm very, very close to a finished mock-up for the much-hyped February Redesign, and I can tell you one thing about it: it's all about the plaid."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/02/project_plaid.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"283\" width=\"257\" alt=\"project_plaid.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">\"Spaceball One...they've gone to plaid!\" -- Barf</p>\n\nI'm very, very close to a finished mock-up for the much-hyped February Redesign, and I can tell you two things about it:\n\n* It's as big a leap forward in terms of usability over the site you're looking at as this design was over the one that preceded it. (And if you can trace all the pronouns in that sentence you get a gold star.)\n\n* Plaid. It's all about the plaid.\n\nThe primary color of the new theme has changed from \"Practical green\" to a lovely deep red, and the new design makes ample use of our identity font, the lovely and versatile Neutraface. And no, your monitors are not broken: the background pattern in the screenshot at right, yes, is plaid. I can't say I know of any other blog, website or online magazine that willingly uses an ugly-ass tartan as its background pattern, and I can't think of a better ugly-ass pattern to use as our background tartan.\n\nMore importantly, the new design makes good use of a sidebar column -- the new home page will include -- for the first time, frankly -- text explaining what the hell this site is and who the fuck I am. The individual post sidebars (pictured) will contain a paragraph placing the entry in context, with links back to the blog main page and the monthly archives. They'll also contain a list of the entry's categories/tags, with links to the category archive page on this site _and_ to that tag's page on Technorati.\n\nSpeaking of category/tag archive pages, those will link to the relevant tags on Technorati and Del.icio.us -- I may even write a little something that pulls in my own Del.icio.us bookmarks for a given tag, for a little linkblog action.\n\nA few things I'm toying with eliminating/omitting in the February relaunch:\n\n* **Comments:** Yes, I know, I go back and forth on this. But since comments returned, I've gotten exactly five of them, three of which could just as easily have been personal e-mails, and one that was just _weird_. I'd love to develop a community around this site, but at the same time I won't deny that _Practicalmadness_ is a more or less one-way conduit of information. Of course, if there's a demand for me to keep comments alive, well, please leave a comment and say so.\n\n* **Non-RSS XML Feeds:** Geeks and nerds know that just as there's more than one kind of \"MP3\" music file, there's more than one kind of \"RSS\" feed. Most bloggers use a dialect of XML called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) for their feeds, but some people prefer a newer, more open format called Atom.\n\n    Right now I think there's still an Atom feed being generated for the blog, but don't expect that to continue. Not that I have anything against Atom, but I've chosen my horse. His name is RSS 2.0. Actually, that's his breed. His _name_ is Mittens.\n\nI've got some other little things planned, but you'll have to wait until next week to see this plaid goodness for yourself. I'm hoping to have the new design up for Valentine's Day (because I love you) but it may be more like later next week until it's all done. Watch this space for details."

    title: "The Life Pursuit"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "What the crap is this? I can get something on fucking _Emusic_ before I can get it on iTunes?"
    body: "The [new Belle and Sebastian album, _The Life Pursuit_](http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/b/belle-and-sebastian/life-pursuit.shtml), is out today in record stores, [shipping now from Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/o/asin/B000E1155Y/demareesworld/) and [available for download via Emusic](http://www.emusic.com/album/10896/10896363.html). However, it is conspicuously absent from the iTunes Music Store. What the crap is this? I can get something on fucking _Emusic_ before I can get it on iTunes?\n\nEmusic is a competing service that gives you copious downloading for a low monthly fee -- in my case, 40 songs for \$10/month -- but only offers music from indie labels. Which is great for when you're looking for Sufjan Stevens or anything from Matador Records, but less useful after many of the indie bands one likes get signed by the majors.\n\nIt's also historically been my impression that while iTunes is the shiny new cineplex downtown, Emusic is the ancient \$3 theatre up in my girlfriend's neighborhood -- that they don't get new releases until they've had a week or two in brick-and-mortar stores and on iTunes. Cause, like, why would one pay \$10 or more for an album when they can download it for \$2.50, unless they actually want the physical CD for their collection? Granted, I've never bothered to check them for new releases, so that may have been a bad assumption all along.\n\nAnyway, the album: it's all right so far. I liked the single (\"Another Sunny Day\") when I downloaded it from [Matador's website](http://www.matadorrecords.com/belle_and_sebastian/music.html) last month, and I still like it. Other than that the album isn't sticking with me yet, but that may change."

    title: "On Inflections and Wild African Geese"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Lemme just say that never having to explicitly tell my WildAfricanGoose data model that its table is called \"wild_african_geese\" now feels like a total freaking luxury."
    body: "I'm starting a new PHP project yesterday/today, and thus taking the opportunity to begin readying [Friendly](http://friendlyphp.org/) -- my simple \"short stack\" MVC programming framework -- for its close-up. We had originally planned on Monday for the initial public release, but it's looking like it's going to be later next week or the following week. The reason for the delay is that, well, I'm changing some shit at the last minute.\n\nThe reason I bring it up is that any new web development frameworks being developed or released right now live in the shadow of Ruby on Rails. Rails is being hailed as the great white hope for web development, with people yammering on about massive productivity gains (translation: getting to bill twice as much for work that takes half as long to do), easy Ajax support and all the bells and whistles that make building a web 2.0 site as easy as not building one. And yes, web-heads, that last bit was meant ironically.\n\nWith all this noise about Rails, it's important to remember that it was not created to raise your hourly rate for coding (or mine) or to make it easier to develop the next Google Maps-del.icio.us-Sapphic Erotica mashup with a fake word for a name. It was developed because [D.H.H.](http://loudthinking.com/) wanted to write [more beautiful code.](http://snakesandrubies.com/presentations/david/) (warning: PDF link).\n\nEverything else that Rails is can be traced back to a desire to make coding more like language: more fluid, more dynamic, more humane and more fun. And a big part of that -- which was crazy shocking when Rails came out but seems to be taken for granted now -- is its Inflections feature.\n\nWhen you create a Rails \"model\" called User (i.e., a programming object meant to represent the database record for one user), it knows that the database table from which it's meant to draw information will be called \"users.\" When you create a model called HappyChild, it knows that its table will be called \"happy_children.\" You don't have to set this up -- Rails just does it, and you never even have to think about whether your models and tables will match up unless there's a major exception to the rules.\n\nI was thinking about this because I _have_ started to take this aspect of Rails for granted, until I started trying to implement this in PHP this morning. And lemme just say that working in a framework where someone has already sat down and made a list of every common singular/plural inflection so that I never have to explicitly tell my WildAfricanGoose model that its table is called \"wild_african_geese\" now feels like a total freaking luxury."

So enter the Cocoa Espresso, which combines a slightly less rich version of Chantico with a shot of espresso, in the same 8 oz. cup for \$3.25 including tax. I call it \"chocolate-flavored crack,\" although I don't know that it's so different from a mocha as to be worth paying 50% more per ounce.\n\n*  \"Attention Fleet Managers and other interested parties.

I think I'd be more enthusiastic if I actually used Yahoo for anything."

    description: "The point of a well-considered user interface design isn't in piling on features, but in providing maximum usefulness. A well-designed interface may in fact do less than a competing product -- that's fine, because the features it _does_ have are the ones you're most likely to need."
    body: "Those lucky stiffs at the [37signals Getting Real workshop](https://workshops.37signals.com/) last weekend [got to play around with their new product, Campfire](http://nickciske.com/blog/2006/01/27/campfire-warms-my-heart/).\n\nI had assumed that [Campfire](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/campfire_on_deck_from_37signals.php) would be an Ajax-powered chat room of sorts (and it is), just as I inferred just from its name that Writeboard would be some kinda collaborative text editor.\n\nOf course, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, a 37signals app (and any user interface, really) is never about what it's about but how it is about it. By that, I mean that the point of a well-considered user interface design isn't in piling on features, but in providing maximum usefulness. A well-designed interface may in fact do less than a competing product -- that's fine, because the features it _does_ have are the ones you're most likely to need.\n\nMy Backpack account doesn't do anything I can't already do with iCal or a paper planner -- to-do lists, notes, et al., are not revolutionary in themselves. The same is true for other technology I love, like Apple's Mac OS X and iPod interfaces or my TiVo: there are many ways to do those particular jobs, and what sets these products apart is their thoughtful solution to the problem at hand.\n\nAnd sometimes such a thoughtful solution can be pretty jarring, like how I thought my previous Mac -- the G4 iMac with swivel arm-mounted LCD -- was strange and alienating until I got to use it and see how much it could improve on every computer I had ever used before.\n\nIf Campfire has easy file sharing, then it already solves one major problem I have: AIM file transfers do not work on the AT&T Yahoo DSL I'm stuck with at work, so those of us in the office (or me and my friends) can pile into a Campfire chat and collaborate."

    title: "Oscars Game, Now With Tip Sheets"

    description: " The Oscars Game has been on for 27 hours now, and things are looking fierce. I&#8217;ll be making the final prizes announcement later this week, and meanwhile I have decided on the final scoring structure for 2006 and launched..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/02/og_tip_sheet.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"257\" width=\"281\" alt=\"og_tip_sheet.gif\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" />\n\nThe Oscars Game has been on for 27 hours now, and things are looking fierce. I'll be making the final prizes announcement later this week, and meanwhile I have decided on [the final scoring structure for 2006](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/about/scoring) and launched a new feature: [Tip Sheets](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/). A Tip Sheet is, well, a page full of tips -- that is, bits of trivia that may prove useful in making your Oscar predictions.\n\nTip Sheets also include a table showing what percentage of Oscars Game players have picked a given nominee -- for example, right now _Brokeback Mountain_ has 70.8% of all picks in the Best Picture category right now. The key to Oscars Game success is breaking away from the peloton: it's not about getting them all right, but getting more categories right than your opponents. In my experience, that means being better-informed and more willing to go out on a limb with a gut prediction.\n\nThe Tip Sheet will show you how close a particular race is -- for example, the Tip Sheet for Best Actress is currently showing Reese Witherspoon (_Walk The Line_) and Felicity Huffman (_Transamerica_) in a virtual dead heat. So that may be a category where you want to apply some strategy: maybe create three Pick Sets, pick Felicity on two of them and Reese on the third. Not that I'm suggesting necessarily that you should do that or that I have done that -- I'm just saying you _could_ do that.\n\nBy the end of the week I plan to start using the Tip Sheets to collate tips, including the nominations and winners from other awards shows, and I'll be adding a comments feature so people can post their own suggestions (or misdirections) and, like, talk to each other and shit. In the meantime, you've got live statistics on each category. Enjoy."

    title: "Welcome to the Future"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If you're reading this on the home page today, you'll notice that I've changed some things around."
    body: "If you're reading this on the home page today, you'll notice that I've changed some things around. This is not the much-talked-about February redesign -- that's still in the works. The February relaunch is getting somewhat more ambitious (as in, [switching to a new blogging system](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/blrb_better_lightweight_rails) sort of ambitious) and there are some design problems I'd like to fix now. So I've decided to give the homepage a makeover to both give you readers a preview of what's coming and to make the site homepage a little easier to deal with.\n\nThe biggest changes are:\n\n* Typography: The main blog font is now a bit smaller, but with extra spacing. The result is (I hope) a more readable blog that looks good on both Mac and Windows.\n\n    The Windows thing is important, as it turns out 45% of my traffic comes from Windows IE users. That's a really low number relative to the internets as a whole, but still a significant enough number for me to want to really, really focus on making my site IE-friendly.\n\n* Navigation: The drop-down menus and recent entries list from the footer has been bumped over to the right-hand column, and the affiliate links and ads are currently banished from the homepage. I'm a greedy sumbitch, so there will intermittently be ads or referral links somewhere on the home page. But for right now I'm focusing on making sure the site is easy to use.\n\n    I've also adopted the \"industry standard\" feed icon used by Firefox and the just-released Internet Explorer 7 beta, although I'll probably cut my own version that's somewhat less standard but still recognizable and more in line with the aesthetic of the site.\n\n* Tags (sort of): At the bottom of every post there is now a tags bar, with links to Technorati.\n\n\nLike so much in life, this design is not final, and I will probably make some major changes/additions to it very soon. But until then, enjoy the navigation improvements and [send me your questions and comments](ddemaree+practicalmadness@gmail.com)."

    title: "SOTU6: Reloaded"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The President's State of the Union Address last night was, like, 7,000 words long. That is way too long to be easily digested by an American body politic desperate for shorter, easier, more vacuous statements from its public leaders."
    body: "The [President's State of the Union Address](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/politics/text-bush.html) last night was, like, 7,000 words long. That is _way_ too long to be easily digested by an American body politic desperate for shorter, easier, more vacuous statements from its public leaders.\n\nAnd so as a public service, Practicalmadness has gone through the text of the SOTU and -- in the tradition of the great Jean-Luc Godard -- cut out the boring bits.\n\nWe give you the abridged State of the Union.\n\n\n## The President's State of the Union Address (Abridged)\n\nAmerica is addicted to oil, and some of that oil comes from the Persian Gulf region, where there is some vague unrest caused by evildoers and ruffians who (a) pose a constant threat to all American citizens and indeed the entire American way of life, and (b) are in their last throes of insurgency in Iraq. As such, American industry may want to kinda sorta start looking at alternative energy sources.\n\nRegarding Iraq, there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second guessing is not a strategy.\n\nTherefore, it doesn't matter what assumptions we were operating under when we went to Iraq, whether they were false or not, intentionally or not -- now that we're there, we've got to let our boys in uniform see this thing through to the bitter end. Oh, right, and the Iraqis too. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country and show that a pledge from America means little. Lemme give you an example: we all know Americans have no intention of giving up their SUVs and monster trucks, which is why my administration has stonewalled the Kyoto Treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- because America keeps its promises to its allies, and only makes the promises it can keep.\n\nAbroad, our nation is committed to a historic long-term goal. We seek the end of tyranny in our world. Which is why we must continue the program of indefinite detention without charges, secret prisons and secret, warrantless surveillance, to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America. Appropriate members of Congress have been kept informed, and it's their fault if the government doing something illegal and they didn't say anything about it when they got the memo.\n\nSpeaking of which, America respects the people of Iran, and we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran. So, like, get to it, Iranian people -- you know what to do. Come on, you know what I'm talking about. Wink wink, kill your leaders, nudge nudge?\n\nFinally, it has been brought to my attention that some Americans are finding it difficult to prosper in the current economic circumstances. The American economy is as robust as it's ever been -- why, ExxonMobil just posted the largest annual profit in U.S. history -- so clearly the problem is that the skills of American workers just aren't competitive enough in today's job market. So we need more money spent on scientific research, and more money spent on our schools. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead Advanced Placement courses in math and science, so that kids in privileged white communities will all have the best possible shot at success in life.\n\nFellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite, and I'm sorry but I have never heard that word 'exacerbate' in my life.\n\nSometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation. My administration could have focused on alleviating the pain of racial discrimination in America's cities, or at least fixed some fucking levees. But that's history, and this is today. Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: will we turn back or finish well?\n\nBefore history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Therefore books are irrelevant, as are facts, figures, evidence and needless criticism. We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward &mdash; optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause and confident of victories to come.\n\nExcept against hurricanes. Cause, like, damn."

    body: "Like, twelve minutes ago. [Head on over and make some picks.](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/)\n\nA couple final notes about the game and the website:\n\nIt took me an hour and a half, but I think I've got it working more or less compatibly on Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer 6.0 for Windows. The following browsers/versions are fully supported, and if you have any problems accessing the site just [e-mail me](mailto:info@oscars.practicalmadness.com) and let me know.\n\n* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher on Windows only. (Mac versions of Internet Explorer are _not_ supported.)\n\n* Mozilla Firefox 1.0 or later\n\n* Apple Safari 1.2 or later (with one erratum, see below)\n\n* Any browser that shares rendering code with the above: Flock, OmniWeb 5.x, Shiira, Mozilla, Camino 1.0 Beta, Netscape 8.x and possibly even recent builds of Konqueror.\n\nSafari users who haven't upgraded to the latest version (1.3.x on Panther or 2.x on Tiger) may notice the home page is suffering from a rendering problem we call \"wooptiness,\" meaning that for reasons unknown the home page is \"woopty.\" I don't have a machine handy running Safari 1.2, so I can't really test for this. I'm going to try to resolve this bug as quickly as I can. It's purely aesthetic, and everything else on the Oscars Game site should be working fine.\n\nBrowsers other than those mentioned above _may_ work. (Opera 8, for example, probably will.) But I'm not going to be able to devote the testing and development time needed to guarantee compatibility with anything but current(ish) releases of the Big Three.\n\nAlso, regarding the fabulous prizes: they're officially still TBD, but will probably consist of some online shopping cash (at least \$25-30) for the winner, and maybe some lesser prizes for second- and third-place finishers. I'll be announcing a final scoring chart and the prizes in the next week or so.\n\nAnd finally, thanks to Sam, Mike, James and Scott for helping me finish and test the Oscars Game this year.\n\n[Now everyone head on over and make some damned picks!](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/)"

    title: "Nam June Paik, 1932-2006"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "A pioneer of avant-garde video and performance art has passed on."
    body: "[Nam June Paik](http://www.paikstudios.com/index.html), the artist credited with inventing video art, has passed away. From the official statement on Paik's website:\n\n> Paik's journey as an artist has been truly global, and his impact on the art of video and television has been profound.To foreground the creative process that is distinctive to Paik's artwork, it is necessary to sort through his mercurial movements, from Asia through Europe to the United States, and examine his shifting interests and the ways that individual artworks changed accordingly. It is my argument that Paik's prolific and complex career can be read as a process grounded in his early interests in composition and performance. These would strongly shape his ideas for mediabased art at a time when the electronic moving image and media technologies were increasingly present in our daily lives. In turn, Paik's work would have a profound and sustained impact on the media culture of the late twentieth century; his remarkable career witnessed and influenced the redefinition of broadcast television and transformation of video into an artist's medium.\n\nAnd from [a remembrance of the artist in _Slate_](http://www.slate.com/id/2135349/fr/rss/):\n\n> It suddenly became apparent that CBS and RCA had no greater right to it than inventive hobbyists, or revolutionaries, or pranksters, or artists. Paik was all four, and he had the knack, associated with all of them, of being in the right place at the right time...From then on, not just the material of television, but its ability to generate original content, became available to anyone who wanted it."

    description: "Oh my, do we have a busy day coming up tomorrow. The Oscar Nominations will be out tomorrow morning, and this year's Oscars Game will be launching at noon Central time. This means that sometime between 7 AM (when nominations are announced) and 12 PM I'll need to have converted the list of nominations into some kinda structured data format."
    body: "Oh my, do we have a busy day coming up tomorrow. The Oscar Nominations will be out tomorrow morning, and this year's Oscars Game will be launching at noon Central time. This means that sometime between 7 AM (when nominations are announced) and 12 PM I'll need to have converted the list of nominations into some kinda structured data format.\n\nThis is less simple and straightforward than it sounds. Believe me, I know: this is the third or fourth time I've done the Game as a database-driven website (as opposed to just e-mail balloting among various Friends of the Site), and every year I've gotten a little bit better and more efficient at breaking down the nominations into a structure my web application can use to serve up some pages. This isn't just a matter of making a list of the nominations -- this entails making separate lists of all the categories, the movies that are nominated and the individual nominees in each category, and setting up database tables in such a way that I can easily set up and follow the relationships between those lists.\n\nOf course, that's not how the nominations are presented to the public: when you read about them on the Oscars website or in the paper, they're always presented as one list with subheadings for each category. So I always have to find a way to parse through that list to extract the data I need and place it into a format that is understandable to computers.\n\nThe biggest reason to do this is flexibility: once I've 'abstracted' the data like that, I can have my relational database management system (RDBMS), in my case a program called MySQL, generate all sorts of different views on the data set from every possible angle. For example: if I want to see a list of Oscar-nominated films (without their nominees or categories included), sorted by the number of nominations they got, I can do that by typing the appropriate query.\n\nOf course, I've never been able to really _use_ this flexibility for much of anything. The Oscars Game's main listing of categories, movies and nominations follows pretty much the same format as any other list of the Oscar nominees. And though I may want to do something else -- like to be able to view the nominations organized by movie, or to add on some additional notes to each category or make it possible for people to add their own comments to a special web page for a category -- I've never had the time to do anything but that one basic display of the data.\n\nUntil now. The 2006 Oscars Game, as I've mentioned, is the first to be built using Ruby on Rails rather than PHP, and as a result this has been the smoothest, fastest experience I've had on my little annual winter project.\n\nI've been experimenting with Rails for about a year, and in that time the closest I've come to an actual, launchable site/service was Cmere Invites, which was taken back to the drawing board in December. So this is the first thing I've written in Rails that people other than myself will actually be using. The best part: previous Oscars Games have taken around a solid week to program. By using Rails I was able to cut that time in half.\n\nThe Oscars Game isn't anything I couldn't have programmed in PHP, but it would have taken longer and it wouldn't have been as good. PHP has a lot to offer for creating modest database-backed websites, and I don't expect that it's going away anytime soon. In fact, next month Practicalmadness and The Killswitch Collective are teaming up to support a public release of Friendly, a framework I've written over the last year to make PHP development easier and more powerful.\n\nBut even with a tool like Friendly I'd have spent most of my Oscars Game programming time crafting and testing the basics, like player registration and saving your picks, rather than fine-tuning the user experience and coming up with new features. Some of the new stuff this year, such as multiple pick sets and Tip Sheets, wouldn't even be feasible to add if this weren't programmed in Rails. This isn't a slap against PHP, just an acknowledgement that it has limitations when it comes to dealing with complex data sets, and Rails has been designed precisely to break out of those limitations.\n\nAdding new features -- or feeling like I have the freedom to do so -- has been the killer part of my new framework-driven web development lifestyle, and that highlights one of the reasons I do this game every year: it gives me a chance to tackle the same problem once a year and apply whatever design and programming skills I've picked up since the last one ended."

    title: "Blrb: Better Lightweight Rails Blogging"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Here's a shocker for you: after almost six years, I am strongly considering dumping Movable Type in favor of Blrb, my own brand-new blogging engine built in Ruby on Rails."
    body: "Here's a shocker for you: after almost six years, I am strongly considering dumping Movable Type in favor of my own brand-new blogging engine, built in Rails. Movable Type is commercial software, a license to which I have bought and paid for. And I think that for its primary job -- the management and publication of text content on the web -- it's still a fantastic product. The problem isn't that Movable Type can't serve the blog; it's that it can't really serve anything else.\n\nTo get right to the point, the February/March Redesign is going to include weekly podcasts and a photolog the likes of which you've never seen. I've tried, in the past, serving both the podcast and a photolog using Rails, and while it's doable it's always been a challenge to make it happen using a piece of software that truly _wants_ to be slinging text. Therefore the podcast and photolog are necessarily second-class citizens in Movable Type Land.\n\nSo I've considered moving to another ready-made blogging package, and I haven't yet found a single one that has what I need. The deal-breaker has been support for multiple blogs. Movable Type has always had it, whereas the major open-source blogging apps I've \"auditioned,\" WordPress and Typo, operate under the assumption that you have one main blog and maybe some other content that's subordinate to that main blog. If you want to podcast in WordPress, you've got to include a text link in a text post pointing to your MP3, which the software will then automagically transform into a podcast. That's great if you want to include podcasts as an extra feature of a regular blog, but what if you want to serve podcasts as an entity all their own?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on photo galleries. There are a few packages out there, but none that behave the way I think a photolog should. I want tags, I want feeds, I want multiple image sizes and most of all, I want to be able to mix that data in with my text and audio blogs and have it still look and feel like a photo gallery.\n\nSo today I've started on a new software project in Rails called **Blrb**. Blrb (pronounced \"blurb\") is an acronym; it means \"better lightweight Rails blogging.\" It's also my contribution to the war on vowels. And it's also an attempt to make a blogging application for _Practicalmadness_ that can serve all the things I want to publish, the way I want them to be published, with no compromises. And it may also develop into an attempt to challenge Typo (a Rails app that started out promising, but in recent versions has gotten unfocused and bloated) by launching a second major blogging package based on Rails.\n\nI can't say right now whether Blrb will end up in use on the main blog -- I'm a pretty well entrenched Movable Type user, and MT does a great job for that purpose. But Blrb _will_ be used to serve up the podcast, possibly as early as this week. (I've already got a rough version of Blrb, with multiple blog support, podcasting and RSS already up and running.) And as I develop it more, we'll just have to see if Movable Type holds onto its little piece of my heart."

    body: "Some of you may have been wondering how the [Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) is coming along.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/og_screenshot.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"200\" width=\"430\" alt=\"og_screenshot.png\" /></p>\n\nAnd the answer is: rather nicely. I've been using last year's nominations to build the O.G.'s database and code, not to mention its fancy new look. And it's almost ready. I'm going to begin gradually moving the application onto the server by the end of this week and working out the best way to get the _real_ nominations into the system on Tuesday.\n\n**The Oscars Game will begin at noon (12:00 PM Central time) on Tuesday, January 31.** The Oscar nominations are due to be announced early that morning, so it's possible that the game will be online sooner than that. Basically: if the website lets you sign up and start making picks, the game has started.\n\nI've decided against doing \"prediction challenges\" (i.e. super-predictions like 'which film will win the most Oscars?') this year, except for one that I'll use as a tiebreaker question.\n\nWhich is not to say there isn't a major new addition this year: _multiple pick sheets_, by popular demand. You'll now be able to create up to three separate Oscars Game \"ballots\" with your total points divided between them. So on those categories you're not sure about, you can make more than one guess and get a few points for whichever one is right.\n\n*Updated Thu Jan 26 at midnight:* I just uploaded [a new screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/91305125/) to Flickr, and set up [a Flickr tag specifically for Oscars Game screenshots.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/demaree/tags/oscarsgame/) For, like, if you're into that kinda thing."

    title: "It's Official: Disney Bought Pixar"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Just as Apple had to look outside its own campus for a solution to its engineering problems in the 90s, Disney is solving its creative problems by buying Pixar. And Disney's clearly under no illusions about how to integrate their own creative direction with that of Pixar: they're giving Pixar's executives control of the whole shebang."
    body: "About ten years ago, Apple needed a new operating system. They had been trying to develop one in-house for years, but management screw-ups and an corps of engineers run amok managed to kill one project after another, until the only option was to simply buy another company's software and retool it into a next-generation Mac OS. The company they chose was NeXT; the CEO of that company was Steve Jobs.\n\nThis was in 1996. By late 1997, Apple's CEO and half of its board had been forced out, and Jobs -- an \"advisor\" turned \"interim CEO\" -- regained unquestioned control over the company he co-founded. And in the almost nine years since then, Apple has come from a death spiral to become the biggest force in digital music and an increasingly influential maker of computers and software. And the Apple of 2006 isn't just _like_ a different company from the Apple of 1996. It _is_ a different company: it's NeXT wearing an Apple logo.\n\nFast forward to another decade and another company down the California coast: Disney needs new animated movies that don't suck. Their last animated picture to not completely fail at the box office was 2002's _Lilo and Stitch,_ and the films released in the last few years have been some of Disney Animation's most embarrassing failures ever. _Treasure Planet_? _Home on the Range_? Give us a break.\n\nThe bright spots in the Disney universe for the past ten years have been the Pixar Animation Studios films they've released under a multi-year agreement that began with _A Bug's Life_ (1998). That agreement called for Pixar to deliver five films, and the last of those films -- _Cars_ -- is coming out this summer. All of Pixar's recent releases -- _Bug's Life_, _Toy Story 2_, _Monsters Inc_, _Finding Nemo_ and _The Incredibles_ -- have been huge critical and commercial successes. There is little reason to expect that _Cars_ will fail to live up to the same high standard.\n\nLast year, Disney laid off the last of its traditional animators and bet everything on making its own computer-animated features. Their first big effort was _Chicken Little._ It underperformed at the box office. The sky in Disneyland really is falling, and so just as Apple had to look outside its own campus for a solution to its engineering problems in the 90s, [Disney is solving its creative problems by buying Pixar.](http://nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/24wire-disney.html?hp&ex=1138165200&en=5aee55756f782bb1&ei=5094&partner=homepage) And Disney's clearly under no illusions about how to integrate their own creative direction with that of Pixar: they're giving Pixar's executives control of the whole shebang.\n\n> Pixar President Ed Catmull will serve as president of the new combined Pixar and Disney animation studios, reporting to Disney chief executive Robert Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of The Walt Disney Studios. Pixar Executive Vice President John Lasseter will be become Chief Creative Officer of the animation studios and Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks.\n\n> \"With this transaction, we welcome and embrace Pixar's unique culture, which for two decades, has fostered some of the most innovative and successful films in history,\" Iger said in a statement.\n\n> \"Disney and Pixar can now collaborate without the barriers that come from two different companies with two different sets of shareholders,\" Jobs said in a statement. \"Now, everyone can focus on what is most important, creating innovative stories, characters and films that delight millions of people around the world.\"\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Steve Jobs is now a Disney board member and its single largest shareholder. I don't care to speculate as to what impact this may have on Apple, iTunes and the future of digital downloading. But this is a really big deal. This makes the Apple-Intel deal look like a one-night stand, and just might even make Disney cool again.\n\nHere's [an additional story on the Disney-Pixar merger from CNN Money.](http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/)"

    title: "Media Merger Madness!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The WB and UPN are merging this fall, and Disney may buy Pixar today. Woo-hoo."
    body: "The Associated Press reports that also-ran broadcast TV networks [UPN and The WB are merging into a single network, called The CW](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060124/ap_en_tv/tv_network), which is quite possibly the worst name I've ever heard. Ostensibly, this merger is due to a sudden realization by executives at the two micro-networks that they should perhaps stop fighting each other for scraps of the teen market and join forces against their true enemy: the four networks that don't suck. The brief AP article gave no indication of what would happen to various UPN and WB shows, but I think it's safe to assume that the combined network will end up with _Gilmore Girls_, _Everybody Hates Chris_ and _America's Next Top Model_ at the very least.\n\nOf course, from the viewers' perspective, this \"50-50 partnership\" will feel more like a takeover by The WB: the Tribune Company (Chicago's own media behemoth) still has a part ownership in the new network, and its stations will make up a sizeable percentage of The CW's affiliate base. So while it may be an even split on paper, for us this means only that _Top Model_ is moving to WGN.\n\nWhich leads us to the main event: [The New York Times has finally caught wind of the rumor that Disney is buying Pixar today.](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24disney.html?_r=1)\n\n> Disney's board voted to give the chief executive, Robert A. Iger, the authority to offer the chief executive of Pixar, Steven P. Jobs, about \$59 a share for the company [which would come to about \$7 billion].\n\n> Disney's negotiators were then expected to approach their counterparts at Pixar to reach a price, and Pixar's board could vote on the deal soon after that, these people said.\n\n> All of the people briefed on the negotiations cautioned that the deal could fall apart at any time. \"This is tricky,\" one said. \"All of the things have to be just right.\"\n\n> Several crucial details were still being hammered out Monday, including the employment contracts for certain Pixar executives, among them John Lasseter, Pixar's chief creative officer and a former animator at Disney, one person said. He is expected to oversee the animation unit that would become part of Disney's filmed animation division.\n\n> The deal would combine Pixar with Disney's animation unit and give Mr. Jobs a seat on Disney's board.\n\nThis is a slight ratcheting-down of the scuttlebutt; late last week the rumor mill was saying that not only was this deal going down, but that Steve Jobs was being approached to become _chairman_ of Disney's board, in addition to his day job as CEO of Apple.\n\nNote that the last time anyone bought a company run by Steve Jobs (when Apple bought NeXT in 1996, the deal that brought Jobs back to Apple as an \"advisor\"), he somehow managed to get the CEO and half the board fired and take over the company within nine months. Am I saying this is what's going to happen at Disney? Possibly. But it's more likely that the deal will have fallen apart by the time you read this."

This week's show includes [something very serious](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/08/life_in_postmomdern_america), as well as a prank call to the Church of Scientology and a feature where I translate the day's news into haiku.\n\nYou can [download the episode directly (AAC audio file, 11.9 MB)](http://podcasts.practicalmadness.com/2006/01/Practicalmadness_2006-01-20.m4a) or you can [subscribe via RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThePracticalmadnessPodcast) or [the iTunes Music Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73907423).\n\niTunes users please note: for some reason the new episode is listed as \"subscribe only\" in the Music Store (whereas the other shows can be downloaded individually). I don't know if this is something I have done wrong, or if iTunes just wants you to stroke its tender subscribe button. Also: I messed up the date on the RSS feed, so it will look like the episode is several months old. I have corrected the mistake, but it may take a day or so for iTunes to reflect the correction.\n\nIf you're listening through your browser or another RSS/podcast application (such as [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire), then everything should be fine and dandy in your world.\n\n_Except_ that Practicalmadness Podcasts are now in AAC/M4A audio format. AAC is an open format preferred by iTunes and GarageBand, and is considered to be the successor to MP3. The switch to AAC means that I can create iTunes \"enhanced podcasts\" (which like \"enhanced CDs\" have extra features yet remain fully compatible with apps other than iTunes) with chapter stops and slideshows, not to mention better audio quality. (Except that my voice got a little buried in the final sound mix somehow. Sorry 'bout that.)\n\nIf you're listening on iTunes or any other Apple audio-playing gizmo, you won't notice a difference. Likewise if you listen using Winamp or RealPlayer (and likely some other apps I don't know about), you should have no trouble."

    body: "Via Daring Fireball: TextDrive, a mere few weeks after closing their final lifetime hosting offer _ever_, are back with a new lifetime hosting offer. I totally, totally hate these guys.\n\nIn fact, [this is the best hosting deal I have ever seen](http://textdrive.com/mixedgrill). For a one-time payment of \$499 you get:\n\n* A second-tier TextDrive hosting account, which includes 2 GiB of storage, 15 domains and all the bells and whistles you could ever want. Plus you'll likely be on one of their servers reserved for lifetime members, which so far have seemed to be way, way more stable than the others, which I have come to call \"gen pop.\" (Value: \$25/month)\n\n* A 9 GiB Strongspace account, with three upload users and unlimited download users. I use Strongspace for secure offsite backups of my work, and lemme tell you -- that shit _rocks._ (Value: \$23/month)\n\n* A 5-user Joyent Connector account, to become available in February. This would include web-based e-mail, file storage, calendars -- all the groupware goodness you could possibly want. (Value: Unknown, but if I were to guess it's gonna be \$15/month based on Gruber's \"8 months\" statement.)\n\nBasically, the above is everything a small business needs for IT apart from a DSL line (and, well, computers and power lines) -- and it pays for itself in eight months. I paid \$100 less in December, and I only got the hosting part. Which, I'll grant you, I'm thrilled with, but now I'm having to seriously fight the desire to buy one of these.\n\nIf you're looking for some truly pro-level web hosting, awesome file storage, mysterious but highly-regarded groupware or any of the above, definitely check this offer out. (And I don't get a <del>kickback</del> referral credit from Joyent or TextDrive, so you should take this as a totally honest recommendation.)\n\n*Addendum:* If you're an existing lifetime hosting customer at TextDrive and _haven't_ already read about this in the forums, <a href=\"http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=8345\">you can upgrade existing lifetime (aka \"VC\") accounts to include Strongspace and Joyent for just \$199.</a>"

    title: "Ho-Hum Tapas and Bathroom Sex"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Sure, this may not be appealing to many of you who may prefer having sex in a bed, or at least not ten feet away from a yuppie eating veal tenderloin. But remember, this is Wicker Park."
    body: "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/del_toro.jpg\" alt=\"del Toro, Chicago\" /></p>\n\nI dragged <a href=\"http://stoppayingattention.com/\">Lucy</a> to <a href=\"http://www.deltorocafe.com/\">del Toro</a> last night for dinner, and it appealed to two of my general desires: charred pork and lots and lots of <em>red lighting</em>. It was satisfying to the palate, but it's tapas, so it was not necessarily satisfying to the hunger. So our strategy became: eat the tapas, then eat cookies. We ordered a potato-garlic aioli thing that was delicious, a bowl filled with fried calamari, shrimp and baby octopus (as such, I can now say I've eaten octopus and found it to be enjoyable), a roasted pork tenderloin with some overly-cumined carrots and -- after, like, 30 minutes of waiting for it -- duck confit. Oh, and sangria.\n\nThe same space used to be a restaurant called MOD, which the owners closed down several months ago to remodel and rework into del Toro. And in the same way one could describe the concept of MOD as \"hipster American,\" del Toro is \"hipster Spanish tapas.\" Also just like MOD, the interior architecture of the restaurant is by <a href=\"http://www.suhaildesign.com/\">Suhail</a>, who's decorated a number of extremely trendy Chicago restaurants as well as the _Real World: Chicago_ house.\n\nPreviously the only Suhail-designed place I've been to is Sugar, a cocktails-and-dessert bar downtown, and I can immediately tell you: Suhail likes private toilets. Both Sugar and del Toro feature a row of individual, private restrooms instead of a larger mens' room and ladies' room, which is kind of nice because it offers privacy, an opportunity to admire the really elaborate wall tile and a less awkward way to have sex in the bathroom. And I think it's telling about me that bathroom sex was the ninth or tenth thing I thought of when presented with the private bathroom scenario. It came two or three things after the wall tile.\n\nIt also came after this realization: this is probably way, way more efficient. Those five private toilets take up the same amount of space as two normal restrooms, which would only have 1-2 stalls (and for men, a urinal or two) for use by either gender at any given time. So let's say you've got three women and one man needing to pee. Even though there are five toilets in the joint, there will still be a traffic jam. This way, everyone gets to take a piss quickly, and in style, and also, see above about having sex in the bathroom.\n\nSure, this may not be appealing to many of you who may prefer having sex in a bed, or at least not ten feet away from a yuppie eating veal tenderloin. But remember, this is Wicker Park. This is a hipster neighborhood full of dumb, pretty people. This is, in short, exactly the sort of place in the sort of neighborhood where having sex in bathrooms is a consideration. Of course, del Toro is a see-and-be-seen joint on the weekends and one may not want to risk wrinkling their outfit before they hit the next club, so I doubt that it comes up very often. But the point is that it's possible, and that a certain segment of the Parc Wicker population appreciates Suhail's concern for their bathroom sex needs.\n\nNow then, onto the reason why I'm digressing about bathroom sex: the food isn't spectacular. It's good, yes, but it's not at all surprising. We had a suckling pig confit at Blackbird last year that was _sublime_, whereas I feel like I could roast a pork loin at least as well as they can, and then I could have dialled down the cumin on those carrots. It was good, but it wasn't at all interesting, which doesn't bode well for a place that bills itself as \"creative tapas.\""

    title: "\"Development\" Definitely Arrested"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Some times these things just don't work out."
    body: "From the Miami Herald: [Fox is still technically keeping its options open, but _Arrested Development_ is most likely dead.](http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/television/13649139.htm)\n\n> Two other sitcoms, the animated King of the Hill and The Bernie Mac Show, are also in jeopardy of cancellation, Liguori said, and added that \"it is highly unlikely\" that the comedy Arrested Development will return to the network after the final four episodes of the season air in February.\n\n> \"It is regrettable that we could not find the audience that that show deserved,\" Liguori said, noting that the network kept the dysfunctional-family sitcom -- a favorite with critics but a pariah for audiences -- around for three seasons of abominable ratings before pulling the plug.\n\n> Two other networks are negotiating to pick up Arrested Development. ABC is mulling over a single-season deal for 13 episodes, while the premium-cable channel Showtime is talking about a two-year commitment. Liguori said there has been some discussion of moving the show to Fox's cable cousin FX, but it's too expensive to be profitable there.\n\nRather than jump into a typical blogger rant about how much it sucks that Fox lacks the vision to keep this awesome show around, let's look at this from the other side for a moment. _Arrested Development_ has been around for three (albeit truncated) seasons on a network that typically cancels poorly rated shows at the first sign of trouble. It cannot be an inexpensive show to make, and not even DVD profits are enough to justify spending more money than you're making on a show most of the viewing audience finds unrelateable.\n\nI think Fox \"gets\" the show, and that Liguori is being genuine when he says it's regrettable the show couldn't find its audience. Some times these things just don't work out."

    title: "Cmere and See My Generous Heart"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I may need some kind of event announcement thing for the Oscars Party, but I'm no longer convinced that Cmere has a bright future as the \"web 2.0 Evite.\" But a simple little app that e-mails announcements and generates attractive event pages? Hey, why not?"
    body: "Well, we're once again approaching a situation where my Cmere software project for managing event announcements/RSVPs will come in handy: my annual Oscar party. After the very educational experience I had attempting a \"developer preview\" launch back in November, I went back to the design stage with it.\n\nCmere, you see, is not technically difficult _at all_: it is just a web app that posts events and provides some basic tools to plan and manage them. The problems with Cmere have been:\n\n* **Feature Creep:** Is this just a glorified Evite, or is it \"Basecamp for parties?\"\n\n* **Simplicity:** Should the interface metaphors be geared towards somewhat experienced users (like myself and my friends) or towards total novice users?\n\n* **Design:** Tabs or no tabs? How do you build something useful that's also attractive and non-officious\n\n* **The Online/Offline Gap:** How do you allow for the likelihood that people will simply call you to say \"yeah, man, I'm coming,\" rather than using the online RSVP feature? And -- this is the big one -- if all people have is an e-mail, how can you make sure they have the pertinent info (date, time, location) without forcing them to remember it or write something down?\n\nIn other words, I'm discovering that there's a reason why nobody else has attempted the \"web 2.0 Evite:\" because nobody responds to Evites as well as they respond to printed invites. A printed invite can be stuffed into your pocket and carried along with you. An e-mailed one has to be printed out, copied to paper or some electronic gadget or committed to memory -- none of which are as simple and easy as simply stuffing the invite into one's pocket.\n\nPerhaps it's just my circle of friends: I'm a digital person who hangs with a less digital crowd, and digital or not this crowd is small enough that I can get the word out more effectively with a few phone calls or e-mails or handwritten notes than I could with a site like Evite or Cmere. In other words, I simply don't _need_ Cmere for invites in my daily life. Really, who does? And the proposed Cmere features that raised the most eyebrows during the last go-round (groupware for organizing parties, clubs, etc) were general enough that they don't need to be coupled to an events site.\n\nSo perhaps I'm trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. But that's fine, because in the process I may have stumbled upon some other problems that _do_ need a solution, and that's rather more encouraging.\n\n\n## That Generous Heart Thing\n\nLike I said, I may need some kind of event announcement thing for the Oscars Party, but I'm no longer convinced that Cmere has a bright future as the grand party planning app I had envisioned last fall. But a simple little app that e-mails announcements and generates attractive event pages? Hey, why not?\n\nSo I may yet launch a hosted Cmere service, and I may not. But I've decided that once I've got the Cmere code to a point where it's usable, I will release it as free software so anyone with the skills to get a Rails app running on their server can set up their own simple event announcements.\n\nI'll warn you: a public release of Cmere is probably months away and will not necessarily be called \"Cmere,\" as I'll probably hold onto that name for whatever hosted service Practicalmadness decides to set up. And it's going to be simple. No extensibility, no themes, no feature requests -- it's going to do one thing and do it well, because that's the way I like it.\n\nI think any Rails developer worth his or her salt would be able to build something a thousand times cooler than the system I'll build, but that's not the point. The point is that this is _free,_ and saves you the two hours it would take to build something from scratch. Meanwhile, I get the experience of building something nice that people can use, and maybe along the way I'll figure out how to build a better Evite."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "There's a question that keeps coming up from fans of this site, a question I haven't been able to answer but haven't been able to fully ignore."
    body: "There's a question that keeps coming up from fans of this site, a question I haven't been able to answer but haven't been able to fully ignore. A question that cuts to the heart of who I am, of who we all are as individuals, and whether this world is real or just a fantasy created for us by a race of super-intelligent beings, or perhaps even super-intelligent shrimp.\n\nIt's the question that drives us (into hiding): _where is my fucking podcast?_\n\nI am pleased to tell you that _brand-new podcast material_ now exists. _The Practicalmadness Podcast, Episode 4: A New Hope_ is currently in production and will be posted sometime in the next week or so. When I say \"currently in production\" I mean not only that I've got a Writeboard somewhere containing the Podcast #4 script, or that I've been testing out some new sound effects and auditioning new talent. I mean that material -- an intro, even -- has been recorded. How about _that_, huh?\n\nNow, there is still an open question in my mind of whether the Podcasts will continue to be a separate feature with their own separate RSS feed, or whether they'll eventually become part of the main weblog. I'm noodling on that and will make a decision by and by. Yes, I said _by and by_. You got a problem with that?\n\n*Some quick addenda:* The new podcast is now finished and just waiting to, um, clear legal. As it were. If it checks out, it should be online later on Friday Jan. 20. The new podcasts are in AAC format (rather than MP3), but other than that nothing's changed. Other than the announcer. He's changed. Well, and my socks. Thank god."

    title: "Regarding iWeb"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "But will I be using it for anything really important? Of course not, and that's okay because this app really was not intended for someone like me."
    body: "I've had iWeb installed for six minutes, and it took me about five minutes to make \"this website\":http://web.mac.com/daviddemaree/iWeb/45F414A5-C3CF-4D52-817F-DD285BFCA67F/Home.html:\n\np=. !http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/iweb_page.jpg!:http://web.mac.com/daviddemaree/iWeb/45F414A5-C3CF-4D52-817F-DD285BFCA67F/Home.html\n\nAs near as I can tell, iWeb isn't just reminiscent of Pages (Apple's page layout tool that comes with iWork). iWeb _is_ Pages -- it would not surprise me to learn that iWeb is just the layout engine and HTML export from that app, mixed in with some basic site management, RSS generation and .Mac access. Templates are packages containing assets and an XML file (just like Pages documents), and iWeb builds your web pages as the last step before publishing them.\n\nThis means that one has total freedom of design on their websites, but it also means that iWeb can't edit web pages that weren't created in iWeb. In fact, iWeb doesn't include any sort of \"Save As..\" or \"Open...\" command, so I'm not certain you can even import iWeb pages that were created on another computer. (I'd be interested to see if the site I just made and published to .Mac shows up on my other computer at home tonight.)\n\nThe reason Adobe's Dreamweaver 8 continues to be the dominant tool for easily making web sites is that it generates decent-looking code, and doesn't do anything to rewrite code brought in from other sources. Most importantly, it reads, writes and edits _code_. A web page as iWeb understands it is a page-layout document that is simply \"printed out\" as HTML and CSS. The good thing about this is that it provides a rock-solid reliable environment for newbies to design their pages. What you see is really what you get, but at the cost of _any_ control over the HTML markup. And unfortunately this means that you can't even copy and paste snippets of HTML &mdash; like Technorati tags or Google search boxes &mdash; into your iWeb pages.\n\nAs for what the code looks like after iWeb generates it, well, the less said about that the better:\n\np=. !http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/iweb_code.gif!\n\n(The good news about that insane mishmash of tags? \"At least it's valid XHTML.\":http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mac.com%2Fdaviddemaree%2FiWeb%2F45F414A5-C3CF-4D52-817F-DD285BFCA67F%2FHome.html)\n\nBut what the hell: if you're willing to accept those limitations, you get the benefit of a beautiful web page, easily created and published to a .Mac account, right? Well, that reminds me of one of the reasons I host my own websites: .Mac's URLs are uglier than that swan dress Bj&ouml;rk wore to the Oscars.\n\np=. !http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/iweb_url.gif!\n\nThat's just the last _half_ of it. Apple must be assuming that if you're unsavvy enough about web sites to be using iWeb and .Mac to build your pages, you probably don't even know what the stuff that comes after the domain name in the address bar is even _for._ And you know, they're probably right. iWeb is a lovely tool that allows one to build some lovely-looking web pages. It is one of many such tools, and arguably the only one that somebody's mom could use. And I'll probably use it for the same things for which I've been using .Mac HomePage (which iWeb replaces), like posting photo albums from iPhoto.\n\nBut will I be using it for anything really important? Of course not. And that's okay, because this app really was not intended for someone like me."

    title: "Senators, Alito Talking Past Each Other"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "From what I have read I don't believe I could support the Alito nomination. But what does the Senate want to hear from Alito -- impartiality or partisanship?"
    body: "An interestingly distanced take on the Alito hearings from Alex Epstein's screenwriting blog [Complications Ensue](http://complicationsensue.blogspot.com):\n\n> The senators are talking politics. Alito is talking law. They are at cross purposes. The senator wants Alito to say (or fail to say) that he'd uphold <I>Roe v. Wade</i>. Alito is discussing whether it is in fact, settled law. I have to side with him on this legalistic point: it is obviously not settled law since cases relating to it keep coming before the Court. The senator wants Alito to say that executing an innocent man is a Bad Thing, but he's asked Alito whether it's constitutional. The Constitution says it's illegal to deprive someone of rights without due process. It does not say it is illegal to deprive an innocent man of his right provided the poor sumbitch has been given due process. It is wrong to execute an innocent man, but it is perfectly \"constitutional.\" ([Link](http://complicationsensue.blogspot.com/2006/01/cross-purposes.html))\n\nFrom what I have read I don't believe I could support the Alito nomination, given his views supporting corporate interests over those of individual citizens, not to mention his support for broader executive power (since we've all seen how well _that_ turns out).\n\nBut what _does_ the Senate want to hear from Alito -- impartiality or partisanship? Do they want to hear that he's an impartial judge, or are they merely trying to place him on one side or another of the liberal-conservative spectrum? Are the Senators using Alito as a political football, sensing this confirmation process as the latest, best battleground in the effort -- by both parties -- to distance themselves from the Bush presidency, and might that not be harmful to our democracy?"

      body: "I disagree about _Roe_ not being settled law, but I do agree with that perspective on Alito's confirmation hearings. \n\nLaw isn't settled, particularly judge-made law. We have a tendency to forget that we have a common law tradition in America. Common law is far more prone to revision than legislated law (Plessy v. Ferguson, anyone?) but that's part of the process. \n\n_Roe_ may eventually be overruled, but not because it isn't settled -- it's as settled as any point of common law can be. I don't find Alito's discussion of such to be disturbing, because he is right on that point. \n\nBut the Senators don't want to hear that, and America doesn't want to hear that, because they don't understand how it works. They parrot stare decisis because that's what they hear on CNN, or morality because that's what Preacher Joe told them was important, and don't consider allowing a judge to do their job.\n\nIt really doesn't matter at this point anyway. Barring a smoking gun or a huge fuckup on his part, he's going to be confirmed. What a horrible day for America. "

    title: "iTunes is Spying On You"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Version 6.0.2 includes a \"feature\" that uses the currently playing song to show you ads for related songs from the Music Store. Why do they need to advertise their \$10 album downloads when they've already got me for a couple thousand dollars this year?"
    body: "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/itunes_ministore.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"188\" width=\"417\" alt=\"itunes_ministore.gif\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\n\nOne of Apple's many releases yesterday was an upgrade to [iTunes](http://itunes.com/), version 6.0.2, which included a new feature called MiniStore that allows one to \"browse\" the Music Store from the comfort of their Library. [The MiniStore is essentially an ad for iTunes](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/evil/latest-itunes-dials-home-without-your-permission-147916.php), placed constantly in your iTunes Library window by default. And if a song is playing or selected in the Library while the MiniStore is open, [iTunes uses that song's metadata (such as title, artist and album) to talk to the Music Store and show you related items](http://since1968.com/article/153/itunes-is-watching).\n\nThis is not okay. A few things that are nasty about this, _apart_ from the privacy considerations:\n\n* One of the things I like about the Music Store is that it's not constantly in your face. It's always there as a resource I can tap into as needed, but otherwise my Library is mine.\n\n* Seeing related _songs_ would be one thing, but the MiniStore pane is generally showing only related _albums._\n\n* From a usability and aesthetic perspective this MiniStore thing is a trainwreck. The iTunes window -- which used to be so beautifully simple -- is now subdivided into a multipaned mess.\n\nYou can turn the MiniStore off, of course: just go to Edit &rarr; Hide MiniStore. But this doesn't address the complaints that it's on by default, the widget to close it is hidden in a drop-down menu (so most users won't even know that it's optional) and it's asking me to buy things I don't want. And that last point, for me, is the difference between a useful \"feature\" and advertising.\n\n\n## Oh, Yeah The Spying Thing\n\nAs for the spying, some [readers over at BoingBoing have determined that data is only sent from your computer to Apple while the MiniStore is active](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html) (meaning that you have it turned on and are in your Library, as opposed to one of your playlists or Podcasts or what-have-you). But as I indicated, it's not obvious to anyone but experienced computer users that the MiniStore _can_ be turned off, so most people will feel like they have to accept it or just not use iTunes: the icon to close the program is a lot more visible than the one that hides the MiniStore.\n\nI will concede that this particular bit of spying seems mostly innocuous: [Apple does pass this data onto a third-party vendor called Omniture](http://since1968.com/article/155/), but the iTunes privacy statement includes language that acknowledges that\n\n> There are also times when it may be advantageous for Apple to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Apple has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Apple to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with Apple&rsquo;s policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Apple website.\n\nLet us call this the \"outsourcing clause:\" Apple reserves the right to use a third-party vendor such as Omniture to \"assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys,\" for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of putting a giant Music Store ad at the bottom of your iTunes Library screen. So it's true that Apple isn't selling their customer data -- they're giving it away, but our data is protected by Apple's privacy policy, so we're supposed to trust them not to be evil.\n\nI'm willing to accept that in the course of doing business with giant corporations my personal information probably passes through dozens of other companies with whom I've never initiated a business relationship and who I may or may not want seeing my personal data. And believe me -- I'm sure some of these providers of outsourced whatever, from phone support to repair services, have access to data that's more personally identifiable and scary than a list of my MP3s and my iTunes customer ID. I don't like it, but I'm willing to accept it, because that's the cost of getting certain services.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are under no obligation to accept it just because I am willing to take my soma and think things over. The part I don't understand is why Apple couldn't have left the MiniStore off by default, or added a dialog that pops up on first run to explain what it is and what it's doing. Just to clarify: **turning off the MiniStore does prevent your song data from being sent to Apple.** But how many people are going to know to do that without being told? How many computer users will think to check their _Edit menu_ of all places? How many iTunes users don't even know how drop-down menus work?\n\n\n## One More Thing...\n\nI kinda like the \"Listeners Who Bought\" feature of iTunes -- I just prefer to see it when I'm in the Music Store, not when I'm browsing my own library. And there's a big difference between seeing it in the Store and seeing it over my own songs: when I'm in the Music Store, I'm in \"buying mode.\" The context is that of a store, and so the information display is designed to provide whatever options will get me to buy more songs. My library, on the other hand, is my sanctum.\n\nAnd iTunes is part of iLife and bundled with the iPod, so its development is subsidized by every Mac, iPod and iLife DVD Apple sells. Why do they need to advertise their \$10 album downloads when they've already got me for a couple thousand dollars this year?\n\n\n<div style=\"font-style:italic; margin-top: 2em;\"><p><strong>Correction:</strong> The passage about Apple's privacy policy originally said \"Apple isn't passing this data onto a third party,\" and Marc of since1968.com pointed out in the comments that on this point my head was up my ass. It's easy for me to say this now, but I had read something about the Omniture thing and was aware that Apple was using a marketing firm, but for whatever reason I let that get snipped during my final copy check before posting. This post has been updated to more accurately characterize Apple's handling of MiniStore data.</p></div>"

    title: "Of Tags and Folksonomy"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "They're coming to this site. You have been warned."
    body: "I wanted to quickly make an amendment to [my post about this site's traffic numbers](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/damned_lies_and_website_traffi) to talk briefly about tags. A \"tag\", in the weblog context, is essentially a new way to apply categorization. Rather than assign a post to a category, you assign tags (which are one- or two-word labels for your content) to your post by typing them into a text field. Your blogging software will then index those tag-words and cross-reference them, so that you can look at all the posts associated with a given tag.\n\nI've previously been opposed to tagging, but my recent experience with Technorati tags and the existence of a great Movable Type plugin for them has turned my head a little. So for my first grand pronouncement about the February redesign of _Practicalmadness_, I'd like to announce that the \"topic\" organization on each post (the little file-folder icons that link to a category) will be replaced (or rather, upgraded) to be more of a tag thing.\n\nThe reason I'm doing this, and the reason why tags are surprisingly powerful, is that the same tag can be used on multiple websites, making it easy to link together related content. For example: I could set up a \"tag view\" on Practicalmadness that not only brings together all my weblog posts, del.icio.us links and Flickr photos related to a given subject, but automatically links into services like Technorati and Digg to make it easier for people using those sites to find this one, and for you to find cool pages over there.\n\nI haven't decided exactly how much interconnectedness I want to bring to the site next month -- for right now, I'm just interested in using Movable Type to auto-generate Technorati tags. But there's loads of possibility, and it's gonna be cool."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Tonight's show promises to answer some questions about the Drug Plane and The Monster. Still not resolved: Whether there are enough sharks and water skis for everyone on the island, or whether they'll have to take turns."
    body: "_Dum da da da dum, dum da da da dum!_\n\n<cite>Lost</cite> returns tonight with its first new episode since November, featuring Mr. Eko as the flashbacker of the week and -- assuming the writers aren't screwing with us once again -- the return of The Monster.\n\nI've been keeping up with the show's page on SpoilerFix.com, which doesn't feature inside spoilers so much as it collects various vague pronouncements by the _Lost_ producers and writers that may point to plotlines in upcoming episodes. Some of what they have to say about tonight's episode, \"The 23rd Psalm:\"\n\n* The monster is back, better and badder. Eko will have his first monster experience. We will be learning more about the monster that will confirm some of the fan theories as to what the monster is, especially in one shot.\n\n* Mr. Eko learns Charlie's got a Virgin Mary statue, and demands the recovering junkie show him where he found it. That means a trek back to the downed Beechcraft full of heroin and a dead Nigerian \"priest.\" \"Eko [is] connected into the story of the drug plane,\" says executive producer Carlton Cuse. \"People are curious about where that plane came from.

    title: "Damned Lies and Website Traffic Statistics"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "On the whole I'm very pleased, and this makes me want to work harder to make Practicalmadness an attractive lifestyle destination for everyone in the 18-35 demographic. Well, and you guys. Oh, come on -- reading this site _makes_ you pretty and single. Mmm-hmm, that's right. Practicalmadness readers equals smokin' hot."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/camera.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"350\" width=\"200\" alt=\"camera.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> I'm going to try to resist shooting my wad, so to speak, about the new iLife and iWork until I get my copies late this week or early next. I went to the Apple Store tonight to see if they had gotten them in, but they hadn't, and I realized that I could save fifty bucks if I ordered from the education store anyway. I like getting new Apple software as soon as possible, but I like fifty bucks more. (When I do write about them, my focus will likely be on iWeb. Although I am a sucker for a new iPhoto upgrade...)\n\nWhat I _really_ want to talk about are damned lies and statistics, specifically the readership statistics for the damned lies I peddle on this here website. When I debuted the last major redesign in October -- the first one to be driven as much by hard visitor data as by my own aesthetic whimsy -- I set a goal of doubling readership (in terms of daily unique visitors) within six months. In October 2005, according to [Mint](http://haveamint.com/), 552 people visited the site. That's been steadily increasing, and in December we had made it to 778, a 40% increase in just two months.\n\nThat's not bad. But let's go ahead and break this down by day, so we can see the _really_ exciting numbers. December's average readership per day was 25. So far, January's average is 31.8. If we were to extrapolate this out to the whole month, that would put January's total around 985 unique visitors. That's 78% of my goal in just three months. Wow.\n\nWhat have I been doing differently? A few things:\n\n* Navigation improvements in the October redesign\n* (Intermittently) including Technorati tags in posts\n* Linking to my own previous posts, so as to provide the double-secret background on these things I talk about\n\nAnd I'm commenting on other blogs more, such as [Signal vs. Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/) and always including my URL. I think I've picked up at least two new regulars from among people who've clicked on my name attached to a comment at SVN. (And hey, welcome!)\n\nNow, onto the bad news: while readership is up, comments and links from other blogs are still hovering at zero. So I don't know if there's something about me that just discourages commenting, or if a site needs to have some huge-tastic number of visitors before it can somehow spark a community, or what. I can't say I care _that_ much, since this site was always ever intended as a one-way conduit of information, but I do find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nAnd while overall traffic and unique visitors are way, way up, they're still way low in the grander scheme of websites. (\"Popular\" blogs like [Kottke](http://kottke.org/) start to feel downright lonely at 1,000 visitors _a day_.) And my pageviews per visit have actually gone down since October, from 1.75 to 1.35. So while there are more of you, you're somewhat more likely to just breeze in, look at a single page, then go off to eat mayonnaise or something. (Don't do that, by the way. It's gross.)\n\nOn the whole I'm very pleased, and this makes me want to work harder to make _Practicalmadness_ an attractive lifestyle destination for everyone in the 18-35 demographic. Well, and you guys. Oh, come on -- reading this site _makes_ you pretty and single. Mmm-hmm, that's right. _Practicalmadness_ readers equals _smokin' hot_.\n\nSo let's go hit the clubs. And, um, bring 984 of your friends along too, will you?"

    title: "Happy Mac-- Whoa, Intel Macs!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "OMFG they did it: Apple is releasing a pro laptop with Intel processors, and -- even more shocking -- are retiring the PowerBook brand name."
    body: "OMFG they did it: Apple is releasing a pro laptop with Intel processors, and -- even more shocking -- are retiring the PowerBook brand name.\n\nThe MacBook Pro is the \"fastest laptop ever\", sporting an Intel Core Duo processor and all the expected amenities, plus a built-in iSight for video conferencing and an Apple Remote. It is, in short, the G5-class Mac laptop we've all been dreaming of for two years. It will be out in February in two models: 1.67 GHz for \$1,999, and 1.83 GHz for \$2,499.\n\nAnd it's a good thing Steve Jobs pulled this rabbit out of his hat as his \"one more thing,\" because I was about to start this post bitching about how Apple's done it to me again by releasing a hot new iMac less than six months after I bought my new iMac G5. The new iMacs are identical to the current models in every respect except one -- they're up to three times faster. Well, and one more: whereas the current iMac G5 has a 64-bit processor, the new Core Duo chip is 32-bit. I somehow doubt that the average iMac buyer will notice or care. These things are shipping today, which means that it is a _great_ day to start checking the Apple site and your local Apple store for a good clearance price on the G5 models.\n\nJobs also announced iLife '06 and iWork '06, which are available today for \$79 each, and the changes there are huge and awesome enough to merit their own post later today or tomorrow. Suffice it to say that [I won my wager](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/i_predict_that_ilife_06_is_for) that Steve would utter the word \"podcast\" at least five times in relation to iLife, and that .Mac has now been refocused on personal publishing.\n\nThe only other new product -- not that Apple needed to announce anything other than the most awesomest laptops ever -- was a \$49 iPod remote control that adds an FM tuner. Suck on that, Creative Labs.\n\nMy original predictions post after the jump.\n\n<em>Correction: I had originally misread the keynote transcript to mean that the MacBooks had two Core Duo processors. The Core Duo is a dual-core processor, so one of those is _like_ two processors, but there is in fact only one of them included in each MacBook Pro. My bad. I have corrected the first paragraph to reflect reality.</em>\n\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Macworld\" rel=\"tag\">Macworld</a>, \n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/iLife\" rel=\"tag\">iLife</a>, \n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Apple\" rel=\"tag\">Apple</a>, \n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/MacBook\" rel=\"tag\">MacBook</a>, \n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Mactel\" rel=\"tag\">Mactel</a>, \n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Intel\" rel=\"tag\">Intel</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"
    extended: "## Macworld Predictions, 10 AM Central Time\n\nMerry Jobsmas, everybody! This morning Steve Jobs will be presenting Apple's 2006 consumer products strategy at Macworld San Francisco (MWSF). I'll update this post later today with some reactions, but first I'll quickly recap my Macworld predictions:\n\n* [iLife '06, with enhanced web publishing/podcasting features](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/i_predict_that_ilife_06_is_for) designed to work with...\n\n* A new, improved .Mac service, with a greater focus on personal web publishing\n\n* A revised iPod shuffle: 1 GB for \$99, with some added features and/or style (and hopefully a display of some kind)\n\n* At least one Intel Mac announcement (even if it's not a shipping product), which I expect because of Intel's two suspiciously-timed announcements last week. The Mac mini and iBook seem to be likely candidates, but it really could be anything.\n\n* Media center Mac mini? Maybe. Just doesn't feel right -- using a computer as a media center is a much different user experience than having a box like a TiVo that \"just works,\" and I don't think Apple would be satisfied with a set-top product unless it were usable by non-techies. So I don't believe we will see a media center that is _also_ a desktop Mac. But a stand-alone Apple media center? Mmmm, delicious.\n\n* Some kind of crazy new iTunes content partnerships? Well, I'll point out that the Music Store was updated this morning as usual, and typically when Apple has some major new content partnership to announce (like the first video deal with ABC) they simply hold off on updating iTMS until after the keynote. But some of the rumors say that the new content is going to be served via .Mac, rather than iTunes, so this may or may not be an indicator of what's about to go down.\n\nSpeaking of which, a reminder to people just waking up that **.Mac is offline until the conclusion of the keynote at about 1 PM Central Time**. That could mean something awesome, or it could mean that some jerk broke the mail servers again. But it most definitely means that your .Mac Sync, iDisk and such will be unavailable for another few hours.\n\nSee you at 1 PM!\n\n**Update:** Here's some [last-minute MWSF predictions from Daring Fireball's John Gruber.](http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_predictions)"

    title: "About That MacBook Pro"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I can tell you about the wattage on its power adapter, what ports it's missing and that it comes with a free copy of Comic Life. But can I tell you how many hours it'll run between recharges? No. No, I can't."
    body: "Since certain people reading this blog are likely placing their [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) orders as we speak, here are some very, _very_ brief notes about the new Apple laptops:\n\n* If you were waiting to get a killer deal on the current PowerPC-based PowerBooks now that an Intel laptop is out, you may be waiting for a while longer: a quick look at the Apple Store website would indicate that the current, non-Intel iMacs and PowerBooks are not being phased out or even re-priced. The Intel Macs are being introduced _in addition to_ current models, presumably to give pro users and owners of existing Mac software who need to buy hardware this year an option that doesn't involve running Adobe Creative Suite under Rosetta.\n\n* FireWire 400 is still built-in, but _FireWire 800 is no longer included._ This is not the end of the world, given the relatively tiny number of FireWire 800 peripherals on the market and the fact that not even high-def camcorders are maxing out the capability of plain old FireWire. But still, owners of FW 800 hard drives and accessories beware.\n\n* Upon close examination of the MacBook Pro section of Apple's website, I see no mention of the thing's battery life. Given that superior battery life has always been a selling point of Apple's portables, this seems rather like they have something to hide. Little details I have noticed: the MacBook uses an 85W power adapter (the current PowerBooks and iBooks come with 65W), and for some reason [\"power adapter port\" is listed as a feature](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/whatsinside.html) even though the average battery life is not. (I'll allow that it's possible that Apple just doesn't have those numbers yet. [Update: <a href=\"#mbpupdate2\">that would seem to be the case.</a>])\n\n* No built-in modem. This shouldn't be surprising, given that Apple started stripping modems out of its products beginning with the Front Row iMac G5 back in October. If you need dialup internet or the ability to send or receive faxes, you'll need to pick up the Apple USB Modem dongle for \$49. (AirPort Extreme, Bluetooth 2.0 and Gigabit Ethernet are all still built in.)\n\n* The audio in/out ports on the MacBook are both analog/digital minijacks; I know the iMac G5 has had optical audio out for a while now, but I'm not sure if any Mac to date has had optical audio going in.\n\n* Speaking of missing ports: no more S-Video out. You'll need to buy the Apple DVI-to-Video Adapter (\$19). I wonder how many PowerBook owners would trade in their modems and analog video out for a built-in iSight?\n\n* [Via Paul Thurrott:](http://www.internet-nexus.com/powerbook_vs_macbook.htm) While SuperDrives on the current PowerBooks will burn dual-layer DVD+Rs, the MacBook specs only mention regular old DVD+/-R. So no dual layer? Apple? Apple? Bueller?\n\n* It has a wicked fast graphics card, so yes, it will run Aperture. However, _Aperture won't run on Intel until March!_ BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Take that, early adopting pro users!\n\n\n## Screw You, Apple Pro Apps Users\n\nOh, and some other information I've stumbled upon for us Mac pro users: a quick look at [Apple's Rosetta page](http://www.apple.com/rosetta/) says that the individual Final Cut Studio applications -- Final Cut Pro, Motion, Soundtrack Pro and DVD Studio Pro -- will no longer be available separately, so that \$49 \"upgrade\" to an Intel-compatible version of the really, really expensive software you've already bought is only available if you own the entire \$1299 Studio bundle.\n\nThe good news, I guess, is that they'll be offering reasonable upgrade pricing for people who are trading in an individual app (like Soundtrack Pro) for the Studio bundle. If you're a current owner of Final Cut Pro 5, your upgrade price to an Intel-compatible version of Studio is \"only\" \$99. If you own one of the Studio apps other than FCP, or if you're still using Final Cut Pro 4.x or HD, it's \"only\" \$199.\n\nUsers of non-video pro apps like Aperture or Logic are \"eligible\" to \"upgrade\" for \"only\" \$49, and are \"encouraged\" to do so before buying an Intel Mac, because running pro apps under Rosetta is \"not supported.\"\n\n<a name=\"mbpupdate2\"></a>\n## About That Battery Life\n\nOver at O'Reilly Network, Chuck Toporek recounts [a conversation with one of Apple's booth monkeys regarding the MacBook Pro's battery life](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8984?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550&ATT=QoD:+MacBook+Pro+and+Battery+Life):\n\n> When I noticed that the battery indicator had numbers next to it, I looked up and saw that it had a little over 4 hours of battery life left. So I asked the gal if that's all it had, and she said, and I roughly quote, \"These are pre-production models, so we're not commenting on battery life.\" So I asked again: \"Will the MacBook Pro give me better battery life than my TiBook does?\" Again, her response was, \"We cannot comment on battery life.\"\n\nI wish Apple had included a note on their specs page saying that battery life information was unavailable but coming soon, since that's one of the _first_ things people buying a new laptop look at.  But I'm glad that it would seem that the MBP's battery life is, if anything, _better_ than the three hours Apple advertises for the current 15-inch PowerBooks.\n\n\n## On Naming\n\nTextDrive's Jason Hoffman had this to say [about the new Apple laptop branding scheme](http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/191/mcbook): \"Would you like some fries with your McBook ma'am?\" He echoes the concerns of many that while the newest Apple notebooks are practically _oozing_ nerd appeal, MacBook is quite simply not as boss a name as PowerBook.\n\nI tend to agree, but as Jobs explained during the keynote, there were two really good reasons to make the change:\n\n* They're moving away from \"Power,\" which is an especially important message for PowerBook buyers who've long since outgrown the G4.\n* They wanted \"Mac\" in the name. Seriously, I expect that while lots of people know the PowerBook name, they don't necessarily connect it with the Mac -- I have, no lie, sold people PowerBooks who came in later to return them because they didn't realize it was a Mac, and instead thought it was a Windows machine.\n\nMore importantly, it allows for a somewhat more elegant variation between different laptop families. Right now they have PowerBook and iBook for portables, and Mac mini, iMac and Power Mac for desktops. What happens if they wanted to add a third line of portables, like an ultralight machine for traveling? What do they name it? PowerBook mini? iBook nano? How about: MacBook mini?\n\nMobile users are way more sensitive to size than price, and Apple knows it. That's why there's the iPod (decently small with more features) and iPod nano (fewer features but insanely tiny).\n\nSo I predict that this year we'll see a retooled Apple laptop line where the distinction between models is based on size in addition to price. Yes, I know they have 12-inch and 14-inch and whatnot, but I'm talking about a _radical_ change. I'm talking about an ultra-portable Mac, deserving of the MacBook mini/nano brand name. We'll have a MacBook Mini for hard-core travelers who need something small but functional. We've got the MacBook Pro for mobile power users who need to be able to go immediately from a photo shoot to Aperture without stopping for coffee in between. And for everyone else, we'll have the MacBook -- something decently small, decently powerful and decently priced.\n\nWhen you look at it like that, I think the MacBook naming becomes downright exciting.\n\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Apple\" rel=\"tag\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Macworld\" rel=\"tag\">Macworld</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Mactel\" rel=\"tag\">Mactel</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Intel\" rel=\"tag\">Intel</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    description: "While I don't want to give the impression that I'm anything but jazzed about iLife '06 -- such that I'll be writing an epic-length post on it alone -- I do want to take a moment to acknowledge some disappointments from today's keynote."
    body: "While I don't want to give the impression that I'm anything but jazzed about iLife '06 -- such that I'll be writing an epic-length post on it alone -- I do want to take a moment to acknowledge some disappointments from today's keynote.\n\n\n## .Mac Pricing Still Kinda Sucks\n\nI think it's great that .Mac has an identity now -- it's the web hosting company for people who don't know they need web hosting. And as web or blog hosting the price is not that bad -- it works out to \$8-9/month for a gig of storage, vast amounts of bandwidth and great reliability.\n\nHowever, paying \$79 for the software you need to make the most out of your \$99/year investment in .Mac seems a bit steep. Yes, I know iLife is free with a new Mac, and many of us find ways not to pay for it. But still, if I were a current Mac owner but not currently a .Mac member and heard about this awesome, easy-to-use web hosting service, only to be told I needed to pay an additional \$80 to get iWeb, that would hardly seem like a bargain. What Apple _should_ do is offer .Mac/iLife bundles: if you buy them together, you save \$30 or something.\n\nOn that same note, I also think that Apple should at some point offer month-to-month pricing on .Mac, because \$14.95/month for a TypePad Pro membership just _feels_ cheaper than \$99/year for .Mac, even though it's almost double the price and not half as easy to use.\n\n\n## iWork Still Kinda Sucks\n\nA great creative tool shouldn't just respond to a need -- it should provide means of expression so powerful that it creates its own niche in your life. I am an iWork fan, sort of, and so I'm frustrated that Apple still hasn't managed to bring enough value to their AppleWorks successor to make me want to use it more than once every six months.\n\nOf course iWork is no competition for Microsoft Office -- it's not meant to be. It's a simple tool people can use to write school reports or make presentations or put together a killer resum&eacute;, whereas the Office apps are intended to handle anything from the simple stuff to the day-to-day needs of a major corporation. Because iWork puts the focus on doing simple things simply, it should be more successful than it is. But let's cut to it, shall we? The biggest disappointment about iWork '06 is that there is _still_ no spreadsheet.\n\nI spend more time in Excel than any other Microsoft product, because I use it to manage my finances and track my hours at work. I would _love_ for Apple to release a simple spreadsheet app, because for the teeny stuff I do Excel is just overkill. But while you can make live, \"spreadsheet-style\" tables in both Pages and Keynote, there is still not an Apple product one can use to open or work with an Excel `.xls` file.\n\nSure, I am aware that there are other spreadsheets available for the Mac. But there are none that have seamless compatibility with Excel _and_ a sufficiently streamlined user experience _and_ which come in a bundle with a word processor I like. Given the choice between an \$80 product I adore and the \$150 product that's merely okay and comes with a spreadsheet, practicality demands that I rock the Microsoft Office.\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Apple\" rel=\"tag\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Macworld\" rel=\"tag\">Macworld</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/iWork\" rel=\"tag\">iWork</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/DotMac\" rel=\"tag\">DotMac</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    body: "I turned 25 last month, and since I'm sure my growing quarter-life crisis will become a running theme between now and the end of 2006 I've created a blog category to house all the generational whining I can manage. And I shall begin this bold experiment in twentysomething self-pity by skewering twentysomething self-pity.\n\nOr rather, linking to someone who is: Daniel Gross's latest column in _Slate_ talks about [what he calls the \"It-Sucks-To-Be-Me Generation\"](http://www.slate.com/id/2134007/fr/rss/), and the cyclical tendency of young-uns just entering the workforce to bemoan the fact that they can't have six-figure jobs, awesome condos and fulfilling relationships _right fucking now._\n\n> The economic jeremiad written by a twentysomething is a cyclical phenomenon. People who graduate into a recessionary/post-bubble economy inevitably find the going tough, which compounds the usual postgraduate angst. And with their limited life experience and high expectations, they tend to extrapolate a lifetime from a couple of years. ...Now, today's twentysomething authors are clearly onto something. College is more expensive today in real terms. There's been a shift in student aid&mdash;more loans and fewer grants. The Baby Boomers, closer to retirement, are sucking up more dollars in benefits. There's more income volatility and job insecurity than there used to be. So, why are these books annoying?\n\n> It's not that the authors misdiagnose ills that affect our society. It's just that they lack the perspective to add any great insight. [In her book _Strapped: Why America's 20-and-30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead_, Tamara Draut] argues that \"with the possible exception of having a larger array of entertainment and other goods to purchase, members of Generation X appear to be worse off by every measure\" than prior generations. Huh? How about the Internet and Starbucks coffee and Lipitor and not having to worry so much about AIDS or crime or Mutual Assured Destruction or getting drafted into the Army and getting sent to Vietnam?\n\nI have my moments of feeling that my glory days are behind me and I'm doomed to thirty years of monotonous drudgery, but I really can't say I understand the statement that Xers are \"worse off by every measure,\" or in any way really, than the generations preceding them.\n\nSure, the \"Greatest Generation\" of the 40s-50s and the Boomers of the 60s-70s had a more solid national identity and an economy more directly profitable to the bourgeois than at any other time in our history before or since. But they also had, like, _a war._ They had the draft. They had segregation. The golden past had a better national narrative, but it doesn't change the fact that unless you were a middle-class white male it was simply not your series of decades."

    title: "I Predict That iLife '06 is For Podcasting"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I do expect that iLife and .Mac will be the sideshow at Macworld. But I think it's an easy bet that Apple's got a better answer for people wondering how to create a podcast, and that we'll know what it is tomorrow."
    body: "I won't bore you with a full roundup of the rumors surrounding tomorrow's Macworld Expo keynote where Chairman Steve will give all of us Mac fans our marching orders for the first calendar quarter -- I will assume that if you care to hear that stuff you've already checked out Think Secret's Macworld 2006 roundup.\n\nI have a strong suspicion that Apple's iLife and .Mac strategy for the coming year will revolve around the ability to easily create and distribute podcasts. The same [leaked Apple page that mentioned iWeb also mentions importing video in GarageBand](http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/01/20060105114200.shtml), and there are rumors that [Apple is planning a major upgrade to its .Mac internet services](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/dotmacbandwidth.html) that may include upping everyone's bandwidth allowance to 1 TB/month.\n\nOne thing I have learned from [teaching podcasting seminars at Digital Bootcamp](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/07/enough_about_the_podcast_already) is that the average computer user really, _really_ doesn't get web hosting. Picking a web hosting solution is like buying a computer all over again, and when all you want to do is post a weekly internet radio show about your cat it's hard to understand why you need to know how many gigabytes you'll be serving month to month.\n\nSo I believe there's a need for a simple, all-in-one product for making _and_ publishing podcasts (and web photo galleries, and amateur porn, and all the other things people create using iLife). Right now iLife has .Mac-powered web publishing built in, but it's lame because it lacks any means to develop the web pages to one's liking. If you don't like the way Apple has chosen to present your video of your new baby's first Christmas, your only other option is to learn how to make web pages and set up hosting yourself.\n\nSo many people just don't put things on the web. I've been working on a web application for Lucy that would allow her to publish her comics (and other work, including video) simply and easily, and I know that no matter how hard I work to build a web app that will be powerful _and_ easy enough to use for someone who hasn't been building websites for twelve years, it will never be as easy as going to iPhoto and clicking \"HomePage.\" And yet, I can't say to Lucy that she should take that one-click step, because the website she'll end up with would be really subpar.\n\nI don't at all mean to imply that Lucy isn't capable of going beyond a one-click publishing doo-dad -- far from it -- just that she shouldn't need to, because computers are more than powerful enough to provide her with an elegant way to build and publish an awesome website. And even if the software to build her perfect website in just a few clicks _did_ exist, she'd still need my help to arrange hosting.\n\nSo my prediction: the new .Mac will be positioned as the ideal place to publish any kind of awesome website -- from a photo gallery to a video podcast -- in a few clicks from any iLife app. iWeb will be the iDVD of websites -- it's the place where stuff you create in an iLife app ends up, to be massaged into a form suitable for your grandparents, friends and even clients. But the secret sauce will be .Mac, which will get an upgrade far more important than any new gizmos or extra gigabytes, something it's never had before: a single, consistent marketing message.\n\nI do expect that iLife and .Mac will be the sideshow at Macworld -- new hardware like an Intel iBook and/or media center Mac mini will be the main attraction. But I think it's an easy bet that Apple's got a better answer for people wondering how to create a podcast, and that we'll know what it is tomorrow."

    description: "I think that Mark Burnett is punishing me for enjoying the \"hidden Immunity idol\" thing on \"Survivor: Guatemala\" too much."
    body: "I think that Mark Burnett is punishing me for enjoying the \"hidden Immunity idol\" thing on _Survivor: Guatemala_ too much, [for the premise for the upcoming twelfth season of _Survivor_ is about three times more twisty:](http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=22154) there will be _four_ tribes, this time broken along lines of sex _and_ age (so cranky old men are forced to vote out other cranky old men instead of blaming the hot girls for making them cranky) during the first week, before remixing into a more typical set of two groups in the second episode.\n\nAnd (as indicated in the _Guatemala_ finale) there will be an \"exile island,\" where one castaway is sent to spend the night alone in each episode, and where (yes) they have hidden an immunity idol.\n\nIt does disturb me when _Survivor_ gets _this_ gimmicky, but then again I spent the entire 2004 Christmas season randomly sighing and shouting \"20 people!\" after the super-sized cast for _Survivor: Palau_ was announced, and that turned out the be the best _Survivor_ ever. So perhaps beyond all the four-tribe, exile-island, [former-WB-actors-and-astronauts-on-the-cast](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117935660?categoryid=1071&cs=1&s=h&p=0) craziness, there will be sufficiently compelling reality drama to keep us tuning in.\n\nThe cast will be announced later today, so you can either breathlessly check the internets for updates, or you can do what I'll be doing and just TiVo the first episode, due February 2 at 7 PM Central."

    title: "Flocking Oneself, or: Stupid Website Tricks"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "It's just so hard to set aside years of education and, like, coherent thought to invent stupid website names like \"Woeba\" just because the domain was available."
    body: "I've just gotten the word that the blog [Go Flock Yourself](http://flocksucks.wordpress.com/) (GFY), devoted to poking the \"Web 2.0\" hype balloon with a very sharp stick, is being retired now that they've accomplished their mission of [driving Team Flock insane](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2005/12/29/wanted-to-destroy-something-beautiful/) with their incessant trolling. Flock, if you were not already aware, was a hot project to build a version of Firefox that somehow incorporated blogging, tags, Flickr and del.icio.us in an orgy of folksonomic connectedness guaranteed to make the bloggerati piss their pants with joy. If you have no idea what I just said, be thankful and hope that we need never speak of this again.\n\nWhat's weird about this sort of hype cycle is that a blog like GFY, which has so much fun tearing down the web 2.0 mythology (\"Everyone builds a web app! Everyone is famous! Everyone is hot and brilliant and Danish!\") tends to _reinforce_ that mythology. To wit: I am so much more jazzed about building some kind of web 2.0 crap after reading GFY, because it makes me believe I can do _so much_ better at being brilliant and Danish than those other guys.\n\nWhereas a blog like [Webosphere](http://webosphere.wordpress.com/), devoted to web 2.0 cheerleading, is just depressing. I mean, how can you not see all those cutesy pastel logos with their nonsensical names and identical feature sets (tags! Google Maps! more tags!) and not want to throw your computer in the river? That's a small part of why [I'm considering throwing in the towel](http://practicalmadness.com/2006/01/my_new_years_resolution) on my web ambitions outside of work and returning to more scholarly pursuits: it's just so hard to set aside years of education and, like, coherent thought to invent stupid words like [\"Woeba\"](http://www.woeba.com/) just because the domain was available."

    title: "My New Year's Resolution"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "How many roles can I possibly take on at once? Which of those roles do I actively want, and which am I putting on because they seem to be the thing to do right now, or because I spend all day reading certain blogs and think, \"hey, I can do that!\"?"
    body: "For their New Year's resolutions a lot of people talk about cutting back on expenses, food, vices, cholesterol -- and here I am wondering if maybe I need to cut back on _jobs._ Or, well, _side jobs._ I'm having a pretty easy time of it, workwise, and I can't say I'm in immediate need of a new office or career or anything. But, well, just look at the number of things I'm trying to be on something resembling a full-time basis:\n\n* Information architect / PHP programmer / HTML designer\n* Technology trainer and consultant\n* Independent Rails developer/consultant for Practicalmadness\n* Independent application software/services vendor, ibid.\n* Blogger and podcaster, ibid.\n* Screenwriter / filmmaker / film critic and theorist / General media pundit\n* Brother, boyfriend, lover, friend, person who remembers to come pick up the video camera you borrowed months and months and _months_ ago\n* Guy who comes home, watches television, eats dinners and gets enough sleep\n\nHow many roles can I possibly take on at once? Which of those roles do I actively _want_, and which am I putting on because they seem to be the thing to do right now, or because I spend all day reading certain blogs and think, \"hey, I can do that!\"?\n\nSome of what I'm reading lately (such as [this post on Daniel Jalkut's _Red Sweater Blog_](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/?p=83)) reinforces a notion I've started to have that the things that seem easy (like building a hosted Ruby on Rails service, like my long-boasted-of Cmere and MightyShelf projects) are in fact more ambitious than any side project needs to be. And the things I put off forever because they seem impossible -- like ever finishing my college screenplay, _Two or Three Things_, or any other fiction project really -- would be pretty easy and fun if I let myself do them.\n\nI've long believed that a side gig becomes your career if you keep at it long enough, and that applies to \"stepping stone\" jobs as much as to things you do for the money while you're waiting for an opportunity to do what you _really_ want to do. For example, someone who toils for years as an intern or assistant editor or production assistant in hopes that one day they'll be asked to edit or shoot or direct may, in the final analysis, be competing for those jobs with people who haven't \"paid their dues,\" but rather have spent their time doing those jobs but on a smaller scale.\n\nSo, for example, if you want to direct films, don't waste your time as a production assistant -- go direct something, then something else, then something else. Don't go around asking for the opportunity to do work that will build your reel or portfolio -- just do the work, and use that to create opportunities to get paid for it. Yes, there'll be more hustling, but when interviewing for the next job you'll be able to say that even if nobody but your friends saw it, you finished something you were passionate about, and weren't just consenting to log videotapes for some production house because you have a vague notion that you want to work in filmmaking and wanted a job other than flipping burgers.\n\nSo while I'm avoiding that thing I hate doing where I spend months going back and forth from vague pronouncement to vague pronouncement involving my various projects, I am wondering: what would happen if I shelved Cmere and MightyShelf, at least for now or until I could get some development buddies, and focused myself on the things I've been training for but avoiding since I was 18 -- would it be the end of the world if rather than being a wannabe internet mogul, I were a competent web developer who's just working to pay the bills while he writes his first screenplays?\n\nI'm not saying I've decided to do that, rather I'm just wondering if I'd be happier (or at least more productively stressed out) if my side projects weren't distressingly similar to the stuff I do at work all day. I think at least one or two of my close friends would, like, pop open champagne if I were to suddenly quit working on these hypothetical websites and start working on hypothetical screenplays -- because while the websites may sound kinda cool, I've been planning some of these movies in my head and talking about them for _years._\n\nThe idea that I should be doing something _other_ than coding is always present in the back of my mind. I've always seen it as a way station before I get around to writing down some of these things I carry around with me, but if that's the case then why am I spending so much of my precious alone time planning websites I'm not getting paid to work on? Do I _need_ these projects, or are they just busywork while I avoid facing other commitments?"

    title: "Discover the Glory That is Practicalmadness's RSS Feed"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Yesterday I realized something: most people who visit the site probably don't know how to subscribe to its RSS feed."
    body: "Yesterday I realized something: most people who visit the site probably don't know how to [subscribe to its RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Practicalmadness).\n\nNow, I'll confess, I had previously been operating under the dumb assumption that people looking for an RSS feed for <em>Practicalmadness</em> would be savvy enough to check the footer (where a link to the RSS feed has lived since the last redesign back in October). Or to notice the brightly-colored feed icons that appear automatically on [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) or [Safari](http://apple.com/safari/). Basically I had assumed that if one were savvy enough to know what RSS feeds were, they would be in the habit of checking these places and I wouldn't need to necessarily call attention to the fact that I had one.\n\nBut yesterday, as I was adding the [Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) banner to the sidebar (and removing that ugly Google ad, although I'll warn you now that it's probably coming back in the next redesign coming later this month) I thought, \"hmm, maybe I should put a link to the feed at the top of the page somewhere.\"\n\nSo I did, and <em>voila</em> -- I've got at least two extra subscribers today.\n\nThe RSS feed for this site is a full-content feed, meaning that if you have RSS-friendly software (like [FeedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/) for Windows or [NetNewsWire](http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/) for Mac) you can read everything I ever post here without having to switch back into your web browser, which is an awesome way to keep up with all your favorite bloggers.\n\nToday I've just added a comments link (so people who read <em>Practicalmadness</em> via the feed can easily click back in to read and post comments), and [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/) has been mixing in some handy one-click tools for e-mailing links to my site to your friends, or adding a link to your [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) bookmarks.\n\nEven if you don't have one of those RSS-reading apps, or if you've checked them out and don't think you need all that nerdy power on your desktop, you can still take advantage of RSS if you have [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) or [Safari](http://apple.com/safari/). Both browsers have the ability to add RSS feeds to your bookmarks as \"live bookmarks\", which will be updated automatically whenever I post something new to the site.\n\nSo if you haven't tried RSS yet, [give my feed a try](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Practicalmadness). It may not change your life, but I guarantee it will make your teeth a little whiter. Totally, it will make your teeth whiter. Um, yeah. Totally.\n\n<p class=\"technorati\">\n\tTechnorati Tags:\n\t<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/RSS\">RSS</a>,\n\t<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live+Bookmarks\">Live Bookmarks</a>,\n\t<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/Firefox\">Firefox</a>,\n\t<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/Safari\">Safari</a>,\n\t<a href=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/NetNewsWire\">NetNewsWire</a>\n</p>"

    title: "iWeb? What?!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Somebody found a page from Apple's website referencing iLife '06 and a new product called \"iWeb\" in Google's cache. I'm officially psyched."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/ilife06_iweb.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"289\" width=\"234\" alt=\"ilife06_iweb.gif\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float: right;\" /> This link will probably not last forever, so enjoy it: somebody found [a page from Apple's website referencing iLife '06 and a new product called \"iWeb\" in Google's cache](http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:pyT36dhl5swJ:www.apple.com/support/garageband/podcasts/+iweb+apple&hl=en). The page doesn't give any details of what, if anything, iWeb might _do_, or of any other new features or changes coming in the new iLife. And since this could very well have been some kind of test, draft or prank, it's possible that there _is no_ iWeb, and this is all much ado about nothing. But here it is, for what it's worth.\n\nAnd here also for what they're worth -- which ain't much -- are my best guesses as to what iWeb might be, if it actually exists:\n\n* <strong>It is _not_ a rebranded Safari.</strong> Safari is a fairly established name at this point, and there's no clear reason to change it. Also: Apple \"iApps\" tend to be software you use to create stuff (whether it's movies in iMovie or playlists in iTunes), whereas apps that are simply for browsing or viewing something tend to get names consisting of single English words, like Safari or Sherlock. There are exceptions to this rule -- such as Keynote, Pages or GarageBand -- but I doubt that Apple would give a new product an iName if it weren't a new creative app.\n\n* <strong>It may be the rumored overhaul of the .Mac service.</strong> I'm not sure I believe that Apple plans to turn .Mac into some kind of mega-subscription service for music and videos. And even if they were to do that, I think they'd be more likely to somehow tie its branding in with iTunes so as to be most relatable to Windows customers who don't know from iLife. And the primary selling points of .Mac as it exists today involve personal data -- you get an iDisk for storage, .Mac Sync for sharing information between Macs and Backup for, well, backing up. None of those are terribly web-centric.\n\n* <strong>It may be a tool that allows novices to create web pages.</strong> This would make some sense, since Apple offers web hosting space as part of .Mac but no easy way to create web pages other than some very, very limited web-based tools. There really are no web page creation tools out there that fill the gap between HomePage templates and using a pro-quality tool like Dreamweaver, and I definitely feel that there's room in the market for an app that lets school kids and small businesses create simple web pages without knowing HTML.\n\n    Offering something like this would help Apple in two ways. First, it makes the entire iLife suite more attractive by giving people a way to not only publish their movies, photos and songs to the web, but to design the pages they're published on, which I think would make the publishing features in the existing iApps way, way more interesting.\n\n\tAnd where would be the most logical place to publish that cool stuff? Why, .Mac, of course.\n\t\n\tThe downside to this: it would be the _second_ time Apple puts themselves in a position to be accused of [\"stealing\" something from Dan Wood.](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/small_and_nimble_the_long_s.html)\n\nI'm officially psyched, and I'm really hoping it's a web page creation app. I get asked by people all the time what kind of software they should use to build a simple web site, and I'm forced to tell them that such a thing really doesn't exist -- all the current tools are too complicated for novices, and anything that can bridge the gap between making web sites in Microsoft Word and learning HTML would be a welcome addition to the web landscape, even if it is Mac-only. I might even be interested in such a thing for simple stuff, like rapid prototyping or even just designing my weblog.\n\nNow, this is all speculation -- iWeb could be the world's first digital desktop popcorn popper for all I actuallly know. But I see a possibility I hadn't thought of yet, and I'm excited.\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/iLife\" rel=\"tag\">iLife</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Apple\" rel=\"tag\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Macworld\" rel=\"tag\">Macworld</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    title: "Your Television Is Awesome Update"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "There are four more episodes of \"Arrested Development\" yet to air, and then most likely a quick exit to make room for something really cool, like bonus episodes of that sitcom starring Pamela Anderson as a blonde girl working in a bookstore. Because I'm sure we'd all love to see more of that."
    body: "Some of our favorite new shows are coming back from winter hiatus this week! Yay hooray!\n\n* _The Office_ moves to its new time slot tonight (and every Thursday) at 8:30 PM Central time; it and _My Name is Earl_ are replacing _The Apprentice_ in NBC's battle to recover some shred of Thursday-night dignity from _CSI_ and _The O.C._.\n\n    By the way, since episodes of _The Office_ became [available for download on the iTunes Music Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=102802072&s=143441), the show has taken over five of the spots on iTunes's list of the top ten most-downloaded shows. The \"Christmas Party\" episode, in which Michael (Steve Carell) gives Ryan the Temp an iPod for Secret Santa, has been at the top of that list for many, many weeks.\n\n* _Battlestar Galactica_ -- [the best drama series on television](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/09/abu_ghraib_in_space) -- returns on Friday night, when we'll finally find out how the standoff between the battlestars _Galactica_ and _Pegasus_ will unfold. Back in September, when the show's \"season 2.0\" ended, two _Galactica_ crewmen were about to be executed for killing an officer in defense of an enemy prisoner, who was about to be raped and tortured by said officer.\n\n    That, I think, is the best thing one can say about a sci-fi series in the 21st century: while most of the genre, even current sci-fi/fantasy/mystery TV poster child _Lost_, are primarily concerned with being spooky for the sake of spooky, _Galactica_ is engaged in the discussion about the War on Terror. The bad news is that it's on the Sci-Fi Channel, although last summer their corporate sibling NBC did \"borrow\" _Galactica_ for a limited run. So if you don't have cable, you'll need to watch it at a friend's house or download it from iTunes on Monday.\n\n* And speaking of the poster child: _Lost_ comes back next Wednesday.\n\n    I'd like to say that we'll find out what the hell is going on with the computer in the Hatch calling Michael \"Dad,\" but knowing this show it's possible that explaining that is on some to-do list for sometime next season and we'll instead be treated to another heartbreaking moment in the life of, like, Jack or Sawyer or Shut Up Kate. Hell -- we are more likely to see an hour devoted to why the upholstery in the Hatch is somehow freaky than we are to see any kind of explanation about _anything._\n\n    And yet, we continue to watch. So really, the only important part of what I just said is that _Lost_ is coming back on Wednesday. _Dum da da da dum, dum da da da dum..._\n\n* Yes, I did see that _Arrested Development_ from Monday night where they basically gave Fox the finger for leaving them to die a slow death between now and February sweeps. That exchange between Michael and George Sr., about the Home Builders Association and putting on a show? Andy Richter in \"3-D\"? The \"live finale(!)?\" All priceless.\n\n\tThere are four more episodes yet to air, and then most likely a quick exit to make room for something really cool, like bonus episodes of that sitcom starring Pamela Anderson as a blonde girl working in a bookstore. Because I'm sure we'd all love to see more of _that_.\n\n\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Lost\" rel=\"tag\">Lost</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Arrested+Development\" rel=\"tag\">Arrested+Development</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/The+Office\" rel=\"tag\">The+Office</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/television\" rel=\"tag\">television</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Battlestar+Galactica\" rel=\"tag\">Battlestar+Galactica</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    title: "Morgan Stanley: Taking Clients to Strip Clubs is Bad"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "And it's a bad idea not because women are worthy of respect, but because they got sued last year."
    body: "Daniel Gross quotes a _Wall Street Journal_ item about [some Morgan Stanley employees who were fired for going to a strip joint](http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/01/01-week/index.html#a000502) while on a business trip. In the wake of a 2004 ruling in an anti-discrimination lawsuit, Morgan Stanley now has a rules against attending \"exclusionary, male-only activities\" while on business trips, as well as a specific ban on \"attending adult-entertainment establishments in connection with company business\".\n\nBut the key point of interest to me comes at the very, very end of the quoted passage:\n\n> [S]uch actions couldn't be tolerated under a new chief executive, John Mack, who is known as a champion of both diversity and regulatory compliance.\n\nPerhaps I'm being overly critical here, but mightn't it be disingenuous to describe someone as a champion of diversity _and_ regulatory compliance, when one is a requirement of the other? I think it would be awesome if an major old-guard financial firm like Morgan Stanley had a CEO who believed in his heart that business should not be the playground of the privileged, white and male. But when you mention \"regulatory compliance\" in the same breath as \"diversity\" it just sounds like Mr. Mack is a guy who knows how to pander.\n\n\"Regulatory compliance\" is something a company does because it has to. \"Diversity\" is something a businessperson should want because it's the right thing to do, although in practice it also is handled as just more busywork the government, the courts and those jerks with dark skin, breasts or crazy alternative lifestyles make companies do just because.\n\nI know that it's a little na&iuml;ve to be calling out the _Wall Street Journal_ for not taking up the good fight against the boys club that is American business, but articles like this make it seem as if placing \"diversity\" and \"compliance\" on the same spectrum means there's a new sheriff in town. What they're trying to say is that this guy Mack will not hesitate to force privileged white men who go get caught in a titty bar while in his employ to seek employment elsewhere, and he should be seen as tough on titty bars.\n\nWhat comes off is that we should be happy that the men running this particular corporation, having lost a discrimination lawsuit as recently as 18 months ago, only _now_ are making it clear that taking clients to strip clubs is a bad idea. And that it's a bad idea not because women are worthy of respect, or because they don't want to send a message that Morgan Stanley is a company that is run by and for \"the boys,\" but because they got sued last year.\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags:\n<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/jerks\" rel=\"tag\">jerks</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/business\" rel=\"tag\">business</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/feminism\" rel=\"tag\">feminism</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/diversity\" rel=\"tag\">diversity</a>\n</p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    title: "And Speaking of an Oscars Game..."
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The site for the 2006 Oscars Game, my annual pick'em game where you -- yes, you! -- can challenge my formidable Oscar prediction skills for fabulous prizes, is now online."
    body: "<p style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:2em\"><a href=\"http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2006/01/og06_preview.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"127\" width=\"400\" alt=\"og06_preview.jpg\" align=\"\" /></a></p>\n\n[The site for the 2006 Oscars Game is now up and running.](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/) The Oscars Game, for those newish readers among you, is my annual pick'em game where you -- yes, you! -- challenge my formidable Oscar prediction skills for one or more fabulous prizes to be announced. The way it works is: you have until 2 hours before the Oscarcast on March 5 to pick who you believe will win each category, and you get points for each correct pick. If you manage a particularly difficult feat of picking -- like sweeping the short film categories or picking all of the \"Big Five\" Oscars -- you get bonus points. The person with the most points wins.\n\nSounds simple, right? It is, but you have to remember: the object of the game is not to pick the best films, but the ones most likely to win the Oscar, which are very seldom the same thing. That means (shudder) thinking like the Academy, which is even harder than it sounds.\n\nAt least, that's how it usually works. But this year I'm trying something different: I'll be offering you the chance to split your points between your regular, \"strategic\" picks, and what I'm calling \"picks of conscience\" -- the nominees that would win if Hollywood only understood what was _really_ awesome about itself, be that indie dramas about male undergarments or musicals performed by singing hedgehogs. The only limitation is that you have to pick from the list of Oscar nominees.\n\nI'm also planning what I'm calling \"Prediction Challenges,\" which are chances to make a more general prediction (e.g., \"What film will get the most nominations?\") for bonus points, and maybe even some trivia thrown in for fun. Because, really, what's the point of wasting four hours of your life watching the Oscars every year if you can't win some points for remembering what Kevin Spacey said after winning the 1995 Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in _The Usual Suspects_, am I right?\n\nRight now we're just taking addresses for a mailing list -- when we've got something more substantial ready I'll send out an e-mail to the people on that list telling you how to sign up. If you've played the game in past years, I've got your e-mail address around somewhere so you'll get the memo when it's all ready to drop.\n\nI still haven't made a final decision on prizes, or whether I'll be bringing over last year's user data, or on a lot of things, really. I think I'll just surprise you by talking about the Oscars Game _after_ it's written for a change.\n\n[Interested? Sign up then!](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/)"

    title: "Dreamhost's Got All The Bomb Web Hosting"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Which is to say that they're running their craziest sale to date."
    body: "While I keep this site firmly in the tepid, competent embrace of the super-admins at TextDrive, I still host a _lot_ of stuff with [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?ddemaree), for a couple of reasons:\n\n* They give me many gigs of hosting space for cheap.\n* I _love_ their newsletter.\n\nSeriously, their newsletter is not just awesome -- it's _incoherent_ and awesome. To wit:\n\n> But first, other webhosts are upping their disk space.\nDon't count on DreamHost to fall behind in this foot race.\n\n> No doubt, those sucker's limits are jaw-dropping.\nAll customers love bandwidth like McAdams loves Gosling.\n\n> Four, no eight, for disk, no for bandwidth!\nAny other host you'd be crazy to land with!\n\nWhat they're trying to say is: right now [they're running a sale where their already-generous bandwidth and storage allowances have been _quadrupled_](http://www.dreamhost.com/shared/comparison.html), meaning you can get a 20 GB web space for \$10 bucks a month. And whenever they do a deal like this, they pass the promotion onto their existing customers, so my \$20/mo plan with 17 GB of storage just got upgraded to 60 GB with almost 2 TB of bandwidth. Those of you who know what any of that means please refrain from the urge to shoot firearms into the air. You could hurt someone.\n\nThis may beg the question: if DreamHost is so awesome, why don't I host Practicalmadness there? As a canvas for _this_ particular website, I just like the cut of TextDrive's jib. (It helps that I paid for a lifetime account there, with a percentage of proceeds going to support the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) team.) But you simply cannot beat DreamHost for serving up media. The podcasts all live on DreamHost, and if I ever get back into the video business you better believe I'll be taking advantage of DreamHost's QuickTime streaming server.\n\nI like to describe hosting with TextDrive as the closest I ever want to get to having my own server -- I have as much control and power as I want, way more than I need, and I can still e-mail the help desk if something is wrong. My TextDrive server is a Ferrari, whereas DreamHost is a bit more like a Volvo: they're both quality, but one's good for making slick corners at 500 Mph and the other is good for driving 5 miles to IKEA.\n\nAnyway, to elevate this post beyond a mere DreamHost sales pitch, I'll take this opportunity to mention that some of the little things I'm building on my TextDrive server are new, improved versions of Practicalmadness.com and Lucy's [Stop Paying Attention](http://www.stoppayingattention.com/). Those, and a little thing I like to call [The Oscars Game](http://oscars.practicalmadness.com/). The new Practical may not be ready for a while, and the new S.P.A. won't be ready until next week. But I'm at my office right now working hard to get the Oscars Game ready to at least take registrations later tonight.\n\nYou have been warned."

    title: "Whoa, Hold It, Apple Created AOL?!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I'm sorry, I can give credit where credit is due, but I'm not about to mentally gloss over the bit about the exploding laptop."
    body: "It's very, very, _very_ rare that someone knows some bizarre piece of trivia about Apple that I don't already, so imagine my surprise when I saw [today's installment of This Day in Apple History](http://www.applematters.com/index.php/section/history/january_4_1994_real_world_meets_eworldworld_sighs/):\n\n> Apple had every chance to be a major internet service provider and the opportunity was never so obvious as glaring when Apple began project Samuel. The result was AppleLink-Personal Edition. For \$6 to \$15 an hour users could connect to Apple-centric resources via the phone line. Apple provided the software and marketing while a little known company called Quantum built and maintained the system.\n\n> Unfortunately Apple and Quantum battled over the vision for the service and during a fat cutting session at Apple, AppleLink was killed. This left Quantum a bit high and dry but Apple compensated the corporation by funding completion of the project. With the Apple out of the way Quantum dumped the Apple branding and renamed the corporation America Online.\n\n> Straight from the &ldquo;Oops, I call do over&rdquo; department, Apple tried to retake the market it could have dominated with an online Macintosh only service called eWorld. The too little, too late effort was announced the first week of January 1994.\n\nSo what you are telling me is: Apple co-developed what we now know as AOL -- the dialup monstrosity most U.S. internet users still use to get connected -- and decided to cancel the product in favor of selling more overpriced Newtons and shitty Performas? Jesus Christ, Apple was stupid in the '90s.\n\nI do want to take this moment to clarify -- as I explained to the guys at the sandwich shop I frequent on workdays -- that I am _not_ a die-hard fan of the pre-1997, pre-Jobs 2.0 Apple. That Apple -- let us call it \"Classic Apple\" -- was run by a pack of idiots. That Apple released the [_Pippin_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin), for fuck's sake.\n\nThe awesome stuff coming out of the current iteration of Apple should not be taken as part of the grand tradition of Apple design and innovation, because before 1997 Apple was the company that managed to develop at least three object-oriented operating system platforms that never got released, whereas the present-day Apple is now on the fifth major release of Mac OS X. When the old Apple released a hot new laptop, [the hot new laptops  spontaneously burst into flames](http://guides.macrumors.com/Powerbook_5300#Problems). When today's Apple releases a hot new laptop, many, many awesome things can be said about it, but I think the most important one is this: _it does not burst into flames._\n\nI'm sorry, I can give credit where credit is due, but I'm not about to mentally gloss over the bit about the exploding laptop."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I can only hope future orientation sessions at SAIC can explain what the hell GFRY means and why those poor saps in 2005 thought declaring war on the English language was cool."
    body: "I just happened to take a look at the website for my alma mater, [The School of the Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.artic.edu/saic/), for the first time in ages. And in the list of news releases on the front page, I noticed the following headline: [Motorola Establishes GFRY Design Studio at SAIC](http://www.artic.edu/saic/public/releases/Fall2005/release_gfry.html).\n\nPoor me -- I assumed that GFRY is an acronym. Sadly, I should have remembered that this is seldom the case in matters involving Motorola. For as fell PEBL, ROKR and RAZR before it, GFRY is yet another victim of Motorola's war on vowels.\n\n> The Motorola Foundation, a charitable giving arm funded by Motorola, Inc. (NYSE: MOT), today announced a donation to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) to establish the GFRY Design Studio in memory of chief marketing officer Geoffrey Frost. Abbreviating Geoffrey&rsquo;s name to four-letters reflects the strategy devised by Frost for Motorola&rsquo;s iconic devices such as the RAZR, PEBL and SLVR.\n\n> &ldquo;Frost was instrumental in making Motorola&rsquo;s brand cool again,&rdquo; said Ed Zander, Chairman and CEO of Motorola. &ldquo;From the start, he shared his infectious enthusiasm for breaking from established norms and challenged us to see the world in a new way. His fresh insights, passion, energy and commitment to excellence in everything helped renew and re-invent Motorola. The GFRY Design Studio will enable students to continue Frost&rsquo;s vision.&rdquo;\n\n> &ldquo;Design in the future will require collaboration across various fields &#8211; art, design, critical thinking and technology,&rdquo; said Tony Jones, President of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. &ldquo;The School is honored to memorialize the legacy of Geoffrey Frost by dedicating one of our imaginative project classrooms as the GFRY Design Studio. We thank the Motorola Foundation for transforming the world in which we live by supporting the education of tomorrow's creative thinkers.&rdquo;\n\nI can only hope future orientation sessions at SAIC's various design-oriented departments can afford to take the hour required to explain what the hell GFRY means and why those poor saps in 2005 thought declaring war on the English language was cool."

    description: "I'm no apologist for Big Media, but come on: giving the label chairman's home phone number to one's fans so they can help harrass him for you was not a very wise move, especially for a 21-year-old girl with a day job on Broadway."
    body: "Well, it would appear that I won't be blogging about the new [Nellie McKay](http://nelliemckay.com/) album, _Pretty Little Head_, because the _New York Times_ is reporting that the CD -- and Nellie herself -- have been [dropped from Columbia Records's roster.](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/arts/music/03nell.html)\n\n> The London-born, Harlem-based Ms. McKay had been fighting with the label over her insistence on a 23-song, 65-minute version of the album; Columbia was pressing for a 16-song, 48-minute version. \"I thought we had resolved things favorably,\" Ms. McKay said. \"We were just finalizing the artwork.\"\n\n> \"Pretty Little Head,\" which features duets with Cyndi Lauper and K. D. Lang and songs addressing gay marriage and animal rights, had already been provided to the press, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Spin magazine called the 21-year-old artist \"a sharp-eared satirist\" and said the album was \"not only a testament to McKay's talent, it's also a tribute to her artistic sense.\" In a four-star review, Blender described Ms. McKay's sound - which is inflected with both cabaret style and hip-hop flow - as \"indie musical comedy,\" and said that \"McKay is pushing forward the craft of the song, connecting Tin Pan Alley to Ben Folds and De La Soul.\" (Ms. McKay said that getting such press without actually having an album for sale is \"kind of nice, because people can just read the reviews and then not be disappointed.\") ([New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/arts/music/03nell.html) via [Atrios](http://atrios.blogspot.com/))\n\nI'm of two minds about how to take this. One the one hand, I liked Nellie's first album, [Get Away From Me](http://amazon.com/o/asin/B0001AP07M/demareesworld/), and would enjoy listening to the new one, and so yes, I agree that it's a shame this is not being released. On the other hand, while [I'm no apologist for Big Media](http://practicalmadness.com/2004/08/the_intrepid_jack_valenti), come on: giving the label chairman's home phone number to one's fans so they can help harrass him for you was not a very wise move, especially for a 21-year-old girl with [a day job on Broadway](http://www.broadway.com/gen/Show.aspx?si=516223&afs=broadwayzone).\n\n<!-- Technorati Tags Start -->\n<p class=\"technorati\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/nelliemckay\" rel=\"tag\">nelliemckay</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/sonysucks\" rel=\"tag\">sonysucks</a></p>\n<!-- Technorati Tags End -->"

    title: "Of ROKRs and Shuffles"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Macworld Watch: Now that Motorola has taken the iPod out of the \"iPod phone,\" it's time to re-evaluate the baby in the iPod family, the Shuffle."
    body: "Well, that was fun while it lasted: Motorola has announced that [the next version of the ROKR music phone will not include Apple's mobile version of iTunes](http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/01/03/no.itunes.on.new.rokr/), and instead will support Moto's new iRadio broadcast/download service coming later this year. Looks like perhaps the Nano screwed _them_.\n\nSpeaking of which, while I was walking to Fox & Obel to mack on some cupcakes last night I figured out the problem with the [iPod shuffle](http://apple.com/ipodshuffle/). The Shuffle has sold well enough, I suppose, and it's expected that a 2nd-gen Shuffle will be announced at Macworld next week. However, it's no longer the smallest, sexiest iPod (as that crown is now worn by the Nano) and seriously -- why would anyone pay \$129 for a 1GB Shuffle when you can save up for an extra paycheck and get a Nano that has more memory, more sex appeal and...well...a screen.\n\nSee, the screen's the thing after all. The concept behind the Shuffle's controversial lack of screen is that it's the digital music player for people who don't know from digital music players -- you just load it up and listen, and you're supposed to relate to it in the way that you relate to a radio station (in shuffle mode) or CD player (in non-shuffle mode). If you're working out, walking around town or -- god forbid -- you just don't know how to work those newfangled MP3 contraptions, you can just slide the Shuffle's big, friendly on/off switch, press play and you're listening to music.\n\nThe problem is that the sort of person who would be interested in an iPod probably _wants_ the ability to scroll through their whole 1,000-song library using a click wheel. Or perhaps more accurately, that's the sort of person who would _self-identify_ as needing or wanting an iPod. If you know you want an iPod, you're more likely (in my own opinion and experience -- your mileage may vary) to want one with a screen.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're my friend Lucy's mom (who just got a 512 MB Shuffle for Christmas) you probably wouldn't say you wanted one until one is handed to you. Not that Lucy's mom is at all unsophisticated, she just likely wouldn't identify herself as someone who needs a thousand songs in her pocket. A screen-less player that holds just over a hundred sounds like a perfect match -- it holds about twelve CDs' worth of music in a package a twelfth the size of the average Discman.\n\nLike I said, I don't believe the Shuffle has sold poorly, but when it came out its bigger siblings were the substantially larger/heavier fourth-generation and mini iPods. Now that the video and nano iPods are out -- and so much smaller than their respective predecessors -- the Shuffle's place in the lineup is simply \"the cheap one.\" And Apple is not in the habit of keeping products around just because they're cheap.\n\nSo it would be my expectation that the 2006 Shuffle will look quite a bit different from the 2005 model. I'd expect the \$99 model to get an upgrade to 1 GB of storage, and other than that there's only two ways to go: they can keep roughly the same body and simply add features (like a screen), or they can go even smaller, and show us once again why it's a good idea to have an iPod without a display."

    title: "Intel Rebrands: Pentium Out, \"Core\" In"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "There have been so many changes in computing since 1991, and yet one thing that has remained constant is the Intel Inside campaign -- that logo, that slogan and that damned jingle. Now, as Apple begins its switch to Intel processors, Intel is preparing a switch of its own."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/12/11_17_2005_notd_intc_nlogo.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"65\" width=\"75\" alt=\"11_17_2005_notd_intc_nlogo.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\" /> Macworld reports that [OMFG, Intel is changing their logo and revamping the Intel Inside campaign](http://news.yahoo.com/s/macworld/20051230/tc_macworld/intelinside20051230) for the first time since its debut almost fifteen years ago. Meanwhile, the Associated Press is reporting that Intel's next-generation mobile processor -- the one rumored to be inside the first Intel-powered Apple laptops coming out in 2006 -- will _not_ be a Pentium, and [instead will be called the \"Intel Core\"](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051230/ap_on_hi_te/intel_brand).\n\nSince 1991 the segment of the population who use personal computers has evolved from a few nerds and business types mostly running DOS, to a society of grandmothers screaming at their 1.8 GHz Celeron Windows XP machines because the spyware is keeping them from looking at online digital photos of their grandkids. There have been so many changes, and yet one thing that has remained constant is the Intel Inside campaign -- that logo, that slogan and that damned jingle.\n\nIn both articles Intel's top marketing executive is quoted as saying the focus moving forward will be on platforms like Centrino (for laptops and wireless) or Viiv (for home entertainment and media centers) rather than on the chips themselves. For the last 14 years you may not have known what the hell Intel did, but you knew it was something that goes inside a computer. While it was incredibly effective brand marketing, Intel has never achieved what it seems they're going for with this revamp, which is to get the average consumer to identify Intel with what a given computer product _does_.\n\nIn other words, they're pulling an Apple. And personally I'm struck by the timing:\n\n* On January 3 Intel will reveal the revamped logo and marketing plan.\n\n* At this year's [Consumer Electronics Show](http://www.cesweb.org/default_flash.asp) which runs from January 5-8, Intel is expected to announce its first next-generation mobile processors, code-named \"Yonah.\" If the AP story is accurate it seems logical that these will be the first products to carry the Core brand name.\n\n* If the rumors are true, Steve Jobs is expected to unveil Apple's first Intel-powered Macs at Macworld on January 10, and those Macs are expected to use what will likely be Intel's first Core Duo processor.\n\nSince Jobs announced that the Mac was moving to Intel processors six months ago, one of the biggest unanswered questions has been how Apple would incorporate Intel's brands into its own marketing, and thereby into the identity of the Mac nerd. Would the Mac use a Pentium processor, like all those other schmoes with their Dell machines? Would we have to peel an Intel Inside sticker off the pure white shell of our iBooks like all those jerks using ThinkPads?\n\nNow it's looking like the answer to both of those questions is no, because I think Intel is making a play to get recognized as the top innovator in the PC world -- the Apple of non-Apple computers.\n\nIntel has already been selling motherboards, chip sets, networking cards and even case designs for years. Basically Intel has found themselves in a position where they do an awful lot of the mainstream PC industry's work, while other companies take the credit. I'd wager that in the same way some Americans believe Saddam planned 9/11, a certain number of PC buyers believe that Microsoft designs the computers. Forget money, forget market share -- if you're a company that's had as much influence in the development of this high-tech revolution as Intel has, to be seen as \"just\" the guy who sells the chips has gotta hurt.\n\nApple doesn't need or want something like Centrino. They've already got a successful mobile brand (PowerBook), and even when they've introduced new products or features with their own brand names (such as AirPort, for wireless networking) they've been very careful to make sure that these new brands are woven into the overall marketing \"storyline\" of the Mac. You don't go into an Apple Store to see an AirPort product, you go there to see a Mac product with AirPort built in.\n\nMy biggest worry about the Intel partnership's effect on Mac marketing has been how the Pentium brand name would be involved. Pentium, as a brand, is arguably better-known and better-trusted by most consumers than the Mac, which is still remembered as being too expensive and not compatible with Windows PCs. And because Pentium has been a strong brand for a whole decade, whereas the Mac is still in the first year or two of its resurgence, the perception isn't that Apple is adopting killer new technology but rather that they're jumping on the Pentium bandwagon ten years too late.\n\nNow it's a non-issue -- obviously we won't know for sure until the first Intel Mac is announced, but I think it's a fair assumption that the CPU powering it will be a Core rather than a Pentium. And while Intel is not dumping the Pentium name right away, they're doing what Apple has done with the G4 and G5: emphasizing that the CPU is only part of what makes the computer do its magic."

    body: "On <a href=\"http://politicalwire.com/\">Taegan Goddard's Political Wire</a> today: \n\n> From a new <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113579153636833083-Xd1XL6NfsXVhzTL0_JKthJ9Wiic_20061229.html?mod=blogs\">Harris Poll</a>: 'About 22% of U.S. adults believe Saddam Hussein helped plan 9/11, the poll shows, and 26% believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when the U.S. invaded. Another 24% believe several of the 9/11 hijackers were Iraqis.' ([Link](http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoliticalWire?m=2437))\n\nI'm always a little bit annoyed to see the phrasing \"another _x_%\" in reports of polls -- it implies that there are separate, discrete quarters of the population who believe these things, rather than a single overlapping 22-26% of people who talk to the Harris pollsters who may or may not be stupid, senile or whose ability to read newspapers or watch television has been impaired since late 2003.\n\nThe kind, gentle, relativist side of me wants to believe that maybe these people have just been bamboozled -- that they're victims of the kinds of mash-ups of Christian religion and neo-conservative political doctrine that we find disappointingly often in the red states these days.\n\nThen I remember that our president intentionally ignores the media and gets his information from trusted advisers, believing the unfiltered media to be controlled by some grand liberal conspiracy to turn all free-thinking people into latt&eacute;-guzzling homosexual robots. Our president, in other words, is in that 22-26% of people who are just that stupid.\n\nIn any event: this still does not bother me as much as people ordering at Starbucks who say \"and then...\" between items in their order, e.g. \"I'd like a venti triple skim latt&eacute;, and then I'd like a chocolate decadence brownie, and then...that's it.\"\n\nIt _sounds_ like they're describing an ordered process: I will drink my 20-oz latt&eacute;, and then they will gorge on their brownie, and then they will do some to-be-determined thing. When in fact they will probably do all of these things at once, pay for them at once, rationalize them at once and forget them at once. It's just another way that we're taking a perfectly good language and ripping it to shreds.\n\nBut hey -- it just goes to show that even in the blue states, among the latt&eacute;-guzzling homosexual robots, we have idiots too."

    title: "Your Upcoming Redesign"

    description: "Do not ask, readers, what Practicalmadness can do for you -- ask what you can do for Practicalmadness. What's that? Glad you asked."
    body: "Do not ask, readers, what Practicalmadness can do for you -- ask what you can do for Practicalmadness. What's that? Glad you asked.\n\nI'm considering a winter redesign that would further simplify how one reads, browses, searches and uses this site. The only thing I'm certain of in my head is that I want to go back to a mostly centered layout (where the invisible CSS box containing the main blog text is centered, rather than left-justified), and I want to roll the studio site for my web development practice (formerly known as The Velocipedist) into the main Practicalmadness site.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I have way more blog readers than I care to have clients -- and that my blog readers will be vehement in their disapproval if I were to move the blog off to another part of the site -- so I expect I'll want to keep the blog as the focal point of the homepage, although I'll want to find a good way to merge my business site with my personal one. And even though I can just imagine the groans, I want to add some page explaining some of the various bits of hyperbole I throw around, such as my whole thing about \"artisanal software.\"\n\nAnd the design will need to be flexible and adaptible enough that I can use it for special projects like the Oscars Game (which should still be ready to begin taking some signups next week).\n\nWhat I ask of you is: what else? What about this site is working for you, and what would you like to see improved in the next revision?"

    title: "On Disposable Podcasts and Impermanent Links"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Maybe it's just me, but shouldn't iTunes be aware that the \"Superman Returns\" podcast will end when the movie comes out, and be able to do something about it?"
    body: "I've noticed more and more podcasts on the iTunes Music Store that are devoted to a transient event, like a movie release, rather than an ongoing concern unto themself. They're shows that will continue for a time, with multiple episodes and regular additions of new content, but which will end at a certain point in time.\n\nPodcasts are a great promotional tool -- as the creators of geek-friendly shows like _Lost_ and _Battlestar Galactica_ can attest -- and what I'm curious about is whether there should perhaps be some feature in RSS feeds to just tell your aggregator (e.g. iTunes's Podcasts feature), \"look, this podcast will end on December whatever, so you can stop polling the feed on that date.\"\n\nYou may be asking: why should anyone care? Can't we just wait for the content providers to stop updating the feed? Or until the feed disappears and turns into a 404 (Not Found) error? And then just unsubscribe from it, rather than going through some song and dance about whether a podcast has a limited run or not? If it ain't broke, what's the big deal?\n\nWeb technologies are generally designed to allow for, if not embrace, transience, but the logical starting point is almost always _presence_ rather than lack of presence. The RSS and Atom feed formats, for example, require a unique identifier for each item in the feed, and the convention is to use a web page's permanent URL (or permalink) since it's assumed that anything you ever post to your website is going to be out there forever. But this is silly -- of course URLs are transient, as pages move or simply vanish from the web. It may stay in the Internet Archive or Google's cache for weeks or years past its disappearance from your site, but that doesn't change the fact that a given page's original, allegedly permanent URL can be rendered kaput.\n\n[I blogged about the impermanence of URLs](http://practicalmadness.com/2003/03/410_gone) almost three years ago, in response to [a Mark Pilgrim post about the little-used 410 Gone HTTP response code](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/03/27/http_error_410_gone.html), which tells browsers that a given page or resource is simply -- and permanently -- non-extant. (HTTP, for those who aren't themselves server admins or web nerds, is the networking protocol that delivers websites to your computer. Strictly speaking a web server is simply a program on another computer somewhere on a network that speaks HTTP, which is why web addresses start with `http://`.)\n\nIn theory, server administrators are supposed to use a response code like this to mark the status of content. Pages that have been moved get error 310 (Moved Permanently), which instructs the browser to redirect you to the new URL. Pages that have been deleted get error 410 (Gone), and that's the end of that. Your browser (and/or RSS aggregator) thus understands that this URL is dead and should not be checked again.\n\nIn practice, things are rather more fast, cheap and out of control: if a page is there you get 302 (Found), and if it ain't you get 404 (Not Found). Now, let's imagine that you're shopping, you ask a member of the store staff to check whether an item is in stock, and when they come back they can only give it to you or tell you they couldn't find it. To make this real-life scenario a little more computerlike, let's imagine that this poor staffer is _only_ allowed to do these two things -- to give you the item, or say they couldn't find it. They cannot respond to further questions (such as \"do you know where else I might look?\" or \"can I speak to your manager?\"), and they cannot say whether the item is gone temporarily, gone permanently or simply not findable right now.\n\n404 Not Found is a temporary state -- it means, \"I can't find this right now, and I don't know why.\" Even if we're all used to the idea that links that fade away into a state of perpetual 404 Not Found are dead, that's simply not what that response code means. And -- this is where we get back to podcasting -- that's now how software programs are meant to respond to it.\n\nI'll be the first one to concede: this really, really does not matter much when we're talking about traditional web browsers. Whether you get back a 404 or a 410, that doesn't change the fact that the page you're looking for isn't there. However, when we're talking about feed aggregators, podcatchers and RSS, it does become a little bit significant. When you click on a link and see a 404 error, you can mentally make the connection that the link is bad and just not click on it again. But most aggregators are designed to assume that a 404 error is temporary, and that if it's been instructed to check a broken feed link every 30 minutes, well, it's just gonna check again in 30 minutes since the feed may well have come back by then.\n\nAnd obviously this only refers to websites or feed files that are pulled down. If a feed stays up but is never updated after a certain date, then your aggregator will just keep asking for it every 30 minutes for all eternity until you go in and tell it to stop. That's really not the end of the world, but why aren't we having the computers do this for us? My TiVo knows when to stop recording _Lost_ for a few weeks, because its programming guide tells it that there won't be any new shows. Is it such a newfangled idea to expect the same thing from a podcast?\n\nThis may not seem like it matters much now, when the devices we're using to consume podcasts are 2 GHz desktop computers hooked into 2 Mbps broadband internet lines -- a single computer asking for a dozen dead links every half hour simply doesn't consume enough resources to be problematic. But then again, a few years ago driving an SUV to the corner store didn't seem like a problem since there wasn't an obvious problem getting gasoline. Gas and internet aren't remotely the same kind of resource, obviously, but it still makes no sense to be wasteful when we can easily build in a way to adapt to changes gracefully and invisibly. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but shouldn't iTunes be aware that the _Superman Returns_ podcast will end when the movie comes out, and be able to do something about it?"

    title: "Apple's Long Boom, Plus My Macworld Predictions"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Almost ten years ago, Steve Jobs rescued one of America's great companies from a death spiral we've only forgotten because the turnaround has been so complete. In 1997 there were no such things as iPods, iMacs, iTunes or Mac OS X. Somehow I don't think we need to worry about 2006."
    body: "The other day I was re-reading Jim Carlton's _Apple_, a rather dishy history of Apple Computer's almost fifteen-year period between the first and second Steve Jobs administrations when they managed to lose the market share war to Microsoft, completely miss the internet boat and send one of America's great modern companies into a death spiral we've only forgotten because the turnaround has been so complete.\n\nWhen I first read the book in '99 or 2000 the iMac had just come out and Apple was starting to turn a corner, but a lot of the things Mac fans think of when they think of Apple -- the iPods, iLife, the PowerBook G4 series, Mac OS X -- weren't out yet. And there was still an undercurrent of fear that Apple might just be putting on one final, brave show before collapsing under its own weight.\n\nOf course I'm writing this on a Mac, an iMac G5 none of us could even have imagined five years ago, using some terrific \"artisanal\" software (specifically [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit/)) from a community of independent software developers who make apps I love even more than a good pinot noir. It's been a very, very, very long time since I've thought Apple could even stumble, let alone fail."
    extended: "And I mention this because I've been thinking about it -- Macworld is coming up in about three weeks, and it's rumored that the first Intel-powered Macs will be announced there -- and because [some jerk in USA Today believes 2006 will be the year \"Steve Jobs will probably get hosed.\"](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2005-12-20-jobs_x.htm)\n\n> That's not so much a prediction as it is playing the odds. Nobody in America gets such a long ride on the oh-we-sooooo-adore-you bandwagon. Well, except maybe Jennifer Aniston. But look what happened to Martha Stewart. Or Hootie and the Blowfish. For that reason, Jobs' popularity will be one development to watch in 2006.\n\nI'm bullish on Apple prospects for '06, and I think it's important that Apple succeed because they make technology that makes using computers less like work and much more human. Take the Mighty Mouse, possibly the least showy Apple product released this year. I use it every day, and it's the most comfortable scrolling mouse I've ever used, because someone in Cupertino actually stopped for a moment and thought about how to make a mouse that people would use every day, not just dream about using as they stood on the peripherals aisle at Best Buy.\n\nThe Mighty Mouse is a pretty insignificant thing -- I mean, who the hell thinks about their _mouse?_ But Steve Jobs's post-1997, reincarnated Apple is successful precisely because of those details. It's because -- and I know this sounds cheesy -- the love Jobs and the Apple team have for technology comes out in those details, because they're passionate in their conviction that humans and computers _can_ coexist peacefully.\n\nJust to give you an example of why Apple will continue to be relevant in '06, late next year will finally see the release of Windows Vista, the long, long-awaited successor to Windows XP. Even though there are some cool-sounding graphics and media features, a new version of Internet Explorer and all kinds of wondrous new capabilities (if you've got a new enough system to run them) what most people want to know is: will it fix the spyware? Will it have fewer viruses? Will it make me safer?\n\nWhat's most notable isn't whether Vista will or won't fix the problems people are having with Windows, but rather that once again we are waiting to pay \$99 for bug fixes more than for new cool stuff. By contrast, folks will be lining up next fall to buy Mac OS X Leopard not to fix problems (we've got Apple's regular, free Software Updates for that) but to get their hands on whatever awesome new features the labs have cooked up since Tiger. To be absolutely clear: it's not that Macs never have bugs, it's just that unlike Windows you rarely have to wait until the next major release to get them fixed.\n\nLike I said, [Jobs's Macworld keynote](http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/media//news/CC518319) to announce Apple's consumer products \"theme\" for the year is set for January 10, about three weeks from today. I'm keeping up with the rumors, I always do, and I've developed a pretty good radar for what's a credible rumor and what's crazy wishful thinking. So far I think that:\n\n* There will be the usual, annual upgrades to iLife and (hopefully) iWork. I'm most keen to see improvements to GarageBand (in iLife) and Pages (in iWork). I'd also love to see a spreadsheet added to the iWork bundle so I can do simple bookkeeping and hours tracking without having to deal with Excel, but that's some of that wishful thinking I was talking about.\n\n* There will be some kind of awesome new video/media center product to accompany the iTunes video downloads and video-capable iPods. Maybe it'll be [a media center Mac mini](http://thinksecret.com/news/0511macmini2.html), or maybe they'll just roll the Front Row media center package out to more Macs. But this is the year Apple expands beyond music and photos across their product line -- the iPod was just the beginning.\n\n* Now for the \$1,000 question: will there be [a new line of Intel-powered iBooks announced at Macworld](http://thinksecret.com/news/0511intelibook.html), as reported by Think Secret? It seems possible, and it would be great business -- Think Secret also notes that [Intel seems close to releasing the dual-core \"Yonah\" processor expected to power the next generation of Apple portables](http://thinksecret.com/news/0512yonah.html) shortly before Macworld at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show. So this rumor has some traction.\n\n    What I'd like to see that isn't in the tea leaves, and is far less likely: iBooks in _black_. With the black iPod and Nano Apple has shown that they're willing to tweak their color scheme, and I think a Yonah-powered iBook in black polycarbonate would be the hot low-end laptop of the year."

    title: "Is The President Above the Law?"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "It seems pretty obvious that he did, so the question is whether the Constitution grants him the authority to do so."
    body: "The question of the week is _not_ whether President Bush -- in authorizing the NSA to conduct illegal intelligence-gathering aimed at U.S. citizens -- broke the law. It seems pretty obvious that he did. The question is whether the Constitution grants him the authority to do so. A column in today's _Washington Post_ tries to defend Bush's actions -- or at least shift the discussion of them into a legal gray area -- on the principle that [\"the Founders intended the executive to have...some powers in the national security area that were extralegal but constitutional.\"][wapocolumn]\n\n> Even as federal courts have sought to balance Fourth Amendment rights with security imperatives, they have upheld a president's \"inherent authority\" under the Constitution to acquire necessary intelligence for national security purposes...So Bush seems to have behaved as one would expect and want a president to behave. A key reason the Articles of Confederation were dumped in favor of the Constitution in 1787 was because [it] created a unitary chief executive [that] could, in times of war or emergency, act with the decisiveness, dispatch and, yes, secrecy, needed to protect the country and its citizens.\n\n> That is why the president uniquely swears an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Implicit in that oath is the Founders' recognition that Congress cannot legislate for every contingency, and judges cannot supervise many national security decisions. This will be especially true in times of war.\n\n> This is not an argument for an unfettered executive prerogative. Under our system of separated powers, Congress has the right and the ability to judge whether President Bush has in fact used his executive discretion soundly, and to hold him responsible if he hasn't. But to engage in demagogic rhetoric about \"imperial\" presidents and \"monarchic\" pretensions, with no evidence that the president has abused his discretion, is foolish and irresponsible.\n\nI was turned onto this column by [a post on Talking Points Memo][tpmpost] where Josh Marshall cites one of those Founders, Thomas Jefferson, who once argued that yes, the executive should have the power to circumvent the law in the defense of the Republic. But there was a caveat:\n\n> If memory serves, Thomas Jefferson argued that the president might find himself in a position in which he might have the right or even the duty to disregard the law or some stricture of the constitution in the higher interests of the Republic...Jefferson's argument, however, wasn't that the president had the prerogative to set aside the law. It was that the president might find himself in a position of extremity in which there was simply no time to canvass the people or a situation in which there was no practicable way to bring the relevant information before them. In such a case the president might have an extra-constitutional right (if there can be such a thing) or even an obligation to act in what he understands to be the best interests of the Republic.\n\n> But that wasn't the end of his point. Having taken such a step, it would then be the obligation of the president to throw himself on the mercy of the public, letting them know the full scope of the facts and circumstances he had faced and leave it to them -- or rather their representatives or the courts -- to impeach him or indict those who had taken it upon themselves to act outside the law.\n\n> As I recall Jefferson's argument there was never any thought that the president had the power to prevent future prosecutions of himself or those acting at his behest. Indeed, such a follow-on claim would explode whatever sense there is in Jefferson's argument.\n\n> If you see the logic of Jefferson's argument it is not that the president is above the law or that he can set aside laws, it is that the president may have a moral authority or obligation to break the law in the interests of the Republic itself -- subject to submitting himself for punishment for breaking its laws, even in its own defense. Jefferson's argument was very much one of executive self-sacrifice rather than prerogative.\n\nI was thinking about this late last night, before I read either piece, and I decided that _yes,_ it makes sense for the President to have the power to take whatever action was required to defend American citizens or the republic herself, but that such power should not come at the expense of the system of checks and balances on governmental power. It makes perfect sense to me that in a time of war we should have the ability to secretly eavesdrop on enemies of the state -- the problem with such a thing is not that it's basically wrong, but rather that no one person or office can be trusted to wield such power without some kind of accountability. The abuse here isn't the spying (well, not _just_ the spying) but Bush's conviction that he should get a free ride because his heart's in the right place. Jefferson, on the other hand, understood and acknowledged that while his heart could and should guide his actions, that did not negate his obligation to the law, the state and the Constitution upon which they're founded.\n\nLet us assume, for the moment, that it was truly impossible for the administration to get warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (which is tasked with providing emergency surveillance warrants for exactly the sorts of spying we're talking about here) with sufficient speed as to do any good. Having come to the decision that secretly gathering signals intelligence or performing data mining on U.S. citizens, even having initiated such a program in clear violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it was President Bush's responsibility to go before the relevant Congressional oversight body (if not the entire House or Senate) to report his actions and request that legislation be adopted to make them legal. It would then be Congress's responsibility to affirm his actions (secretly, if necessary) or to censure or impeach him. Had Bush been willing to submit his power to _any_ meaningful oversight, the end result would likely be the same: the FISC would likely have granted the warrants, or Congress would have granted him some measure of independence once he had made a specific request for a specific goal.\n\nBush instead did neither, having been advised by his lawyers that the use-of-force authorization passed by Congress right after 9/11 could be interpreted to also authorize just about anything security-related at all ever.\n\n\n## About That Resolution\n\nThere's an article in the _San Francisco Chronicle_ today that discusses [the source of all this hoo-hah, the Authorization for the Use of Military Force][sfgate] passed by Congress a week after 9/11.\n\n> President Bush cited the resolution, [as] did Attorney General Gonzales, who said in a separate session with reporters that the congressional measure, in addition to the president's inherent power as commander in chief, gave the government the power \"to engage in this kind of signals intelligence.\"\n\n> The resolution itself is a single sentence, adopted unanimously by the Senate and with only one dissenting vote in the House (by Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland). It provides the president with sweeping but vaguely defined authority \"to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\"\n\n> The resolution makes no mention of surveillance activity. Nor does it specify what is supposed to happen when American citizens, not themselves suspected of violating any law, come to the government's attention through actions taken under the resolution's terms.\n\n> \"Nobody, nobody thought when we passed a resolution to invade Afghanistan and to fight the war on terror -- including myself who voted for it -- thought that this was an authorization to allow a wiretapping against the law of the United States,\" Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said Monday on NBC's \"Today.\"\n\nIt is true that that resolution can be interpreted as a blank check, provided that (a) there is some demonstrable connection between the action taken and the 9/11 attacks, and (b) that you assume the President's role as commander-in-chief of the military means that any action taken by the executive branch is authorized as \"military force.\" Those are two awfully big assumptions, and until this year I believe Bush enjoyed sufficient benefit of the doubt that \"because I said so\" would be a good enough answer. It wouldn't have been legal, but at one time his war on terror enjoyed enough public support for nobody to care.\n\nFortunately for our democracy this is no longer the case.\n\n[wapocolumn]:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/19/AR2005121901027.html\n[tpmpost]:http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007290.php\n[sfgate]:http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/12/20/MNG87GAQBC1.DTL \n"

    body: "And I mention this of course out of self-interest and an interest in spreading the word about things that are frickin' cool. I use both of these products, find them to be delightful and expect that if you (a) spend a lot of time on the web, say at work, and (b) could use a little bit more organization in your life (but not too much), then you should at the very least check out [Backpack](http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BP6XW).\n\n[I've posted about Backpack](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/backpack_somewhat_useful_somewhat_mobile) and mention it pretty frequently; it's basically a place to keep to-do lists and notes to yourself. Backpack's \"pages\" -- collections of those little bits of data -- are super-easy to edit and manipulate, and they can be shared so you and some friends can collaborate on any sort of project, from a birthday party to starting a company. You also get easy access to another [37signals-produced](http://37signals.com/) web app, [Writeboard](http://writeboard.com/): anyone can create a Writeboard (which is a text document you can share with other users) for free, but using Backpack (or its more business-oriented big brother, [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=practicalmadness)) you can keep all your Writeboards together and/or assign them to a Backpack page. In short, Backpack helps me keep my life on track. And I now get free service if you sign up using the links on this site -- I just wanted to take a paragraph to explain why Backpack is awesome so you didn't think I was just linking to any old thing that promised to give me some money.\n\nPlus, it was born here in Chicago. Rock on.\n\n\n## More fun with web apps\n\nA quick roundup of some web development, uh, developments since the last time I posted on the subject:\n\n* Google now offers music search; you can get lyrics, band info and buy-links to iTunes, eMusic and other fine purveyors of the virtual by prepending `music:` to your search, e.g., `music:\"Imogen Heap\"`, or just going directly to [the Google Music Search page](http://google.com/musicsearch/). And a reminder: Google does the same thing for movies; just start your search with `movie:` if you're looking for a specific film, or search for `movie:movies (your zip code)` to get movie showtimes for your area.\n\n* Speaking of Google, they launched a number of new Gmail features this week, including a mobile edition you can reach by going to <http://m.gmail.com> on your mobile phone's web browser. I can see this being super-useful for people who don't have the right kind of e-mail software or internet access on their phone to access Gmail via POP. In fact, I _can_ get to my Gmail account using my phone's email software and I'm think I might prefer the Gmail Mobile interface. Also just added: contact groups, vacation auto-replies and an awesome new feature that lets you view Microsoft Office or PDF attachments as HTML from within Gmail. Very cool.\n\t\n* [Yahoo! has just launched Open Shortcuts](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000227.html), a way for power users to set up pre-defined functions or keywords for frequently-visited URLs and searches. In other words, if you have a Yahoo Search toolbar or visit the Yahoo Search site, you could type in `!ebay lamps` to search for \"lamps\" on eBay. Still haven't tried this myself -- partly because I'm so used to using Safari's built-in Google search -- but it seems quite nice. I continue to be excited about the Yahoo-Google arms race. Can we have flying cars next?"

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Now us Rails developers can quit whining about version 1.0 and get onto what's truly important: whining about version 1.1."
    body: "<img src=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/images/rails.png\" alt=\"Rails logo\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> And there was much rejoicing: [Ruby on Rails 1.0 has been released](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/ruby_on_rails_10_is_live_with_a_new_site_too.php). Of course, as [D.H.H.](http://loudthinking.com/) pointed out at the [Snakes and Rubies](http://snakesandrubies.com/) talk weekend before last, they've actually been a backward-compatible, more or less production ready beast of _awesome_ for at least a few months, but this is sweetly symbolic nonetheless. Mad props go out, of course, to the [Rails Core Team](http://www.rubyonrails.org/core). Now us Rails developers can quit whining about version 1.0 and get onto what's truly important: whining about version 1.1.\n\nAlso, check out Rails's birthday present: [a completely redesigned website](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) with some fresh aesthetic sauce from [37signals](http://37signals.com/).\n\nIn other Rails news, the new \"RJS\" (Ruby+JavaScript) template API (which are powerful meta-programming macros to automate writing JavaScript to glue together all the various parts of an Ajax-enabled Rails app) isn't even _done_ yet and it's already being talked about in a Pragmatic Programmers book. The latest beta copy of [Pragmatic Ajax](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ajax/) has a few paragraphs on RJS, as well as some good coverage of all things Ajax for Java, PHP, .NET and (of course) Rails. (RJS, by the way, is available now on Edge Rails -- just run `rake freeze_edge` from your Rails app directory to download and use it.)"

    title: "Home Networks, or: The Monster Under My TiVo"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "We are proud to present the Practicalmadness Guide to home networking. I promise, it'll be short."
    body: "From Lifehacker: <a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com/software/home-network/mit-grad-i-needed-help-setting-up-my-home-network-141759.php\">MIT grad: \"I needed help setting up my home network\"</a>:\n\n> MIT grad and former Apple executive Don Norman recently said that instead of hooking up his own home network, he hired someone to do it for him. His point, of course, is that home networking is so difficult fewer people do it.\n\nThis seemed somehow appropriate, given that last night -- for the first time since I moved into my apartment and set up my first-ever home Wi-Fi network -- I had a DSL problem that required me to have to _touch_ any of the networking gear I keep stuffed into a cabinet underneath the TiVo. It turned out to be the simplest connectivity problem you can have: the DSL line got scared that there were monsters under its bed, so it just needed a hug, a reassurance and a quick, easy reboot of about nine gizmos, including a router and two computers.\n\nThere's a lot that could be done to make home networking easier, but the biggest and easiest single thing is to try to educate people that it's _not that scary after all_. All I know about networking is that you plug some things into some other things, and 99% of the time things Just Work. Of course, the equipment you buy matters (but not too much), and there are a couple of basic little things it's good to know. So we are proud to present the Practicalmadness Guide to home networking. I promise, it'll be short."
    extended: "A _home network_ is any set of connections between computers that happens to be in your home. You can use any kind of connection cable or technology to network two or more computers -- you can use USB, FireWire, Bluetooth, modems and phone lines, parallel printer cables, pretty much anything except a ball of twine.\n\nThat being said, the kind of network you're likely after is the kind that's used for internet connections, in which case you'll have two choices: wired or unwired. In either case, you'll need to make sure your computer has a _network card_ or _network adapter_, and you'll likely also need a device called a _router_.\n\nMost computers nowadays come with network cards already built in. Your networking won't get any faster if you install your own, so if you've got one just stick with that one. If you don't have one, I would recommend you buy Linksys: they're inexpensive and I've yet to have a major problem with any of my Linksys gear. You can get a [USB wireless network adapter for about \$40-50 on Amazon](http://amazon.com/o/asin/B00009X6PH/demareesworld) that's super-easy to set up and works every bit as well as something you'd have to install inside your computer.\n\nFor the router I recommend either Linksys or (if you're going wireless and don't mind spending double the price) Apple. Apple's routers are the best I've seen -- they work well with Macs and PCs, they have the easiest setup of anything out there and the \$129 [AirPort Express](http://amazon.com/o/asin/B0002GDIII/demareesworld) is a super-tiny wireless router that includes a print server and music streaming. If you can't/don't want to go that expensive, I'd recommend the [Linksys Compact Wireless-G Broadband Router](http://amazon.com/o/asin/B0007MGG2M/demareesworld), currently \$39 on Amazon.com, even if you don't want to do the wireless thang. I recommend it because it's reliable, it's super-tiny and it has 4 Ethernet ports (for wired networking) built right in.\n\nNow, I've been throwing around this whole wired/wireless thing like it doesn't matter, and it really doesn't. I have a wireless network in my home because I wanted my computer on the opposite side of the room from my phone line, and the Linksys router I chose allows both wired and wireless connections for the same money. My computer came with built-in wireless, so I daresay it would have been _more_ expensive for me otherwise since I'd have had to also buy a bunch of expensive Ethernet cable. (Ethernet is the standard connection for a wired network; it looks like an extra-thick telephone wire.)\n\nNow there's one thing about my setup that is probably not going to be the case for about 78% of you: I use a Mac. I've had to set up networks on Windows, and it's not difficult, but it's never going to be as easy or reliable as networking a Mac.\n\nIt's not _that_ hard either way, but one persistent problem I've had with Windows machines is that they sometimes lose the connection and have to be restarted. Some machines have that problem and some don't, and it's easy to believe that the reason is because you have somehow failed to appease the machine gods by having a professional install your network. This is not the case. It's just that your Windows computer is lonely and wants you to touch its restart button. It wants this sometimes.\n\nThe hardest part of setting up a home network that's connected to the internets is, well, the internets part. If you're setting up a broadband internet connection for the first time, you'll want to follow the instructions provided by your internet company carefully, and don't be afraid to call tech support if you hit a wall. Some providers will even walk you through the process of setting up your network, although this part is usually super-simple.\n\nThe exact ins and outs are a little different depending on which gear you have and which company provides your internet access. The basic outline is:\n\n* Set up your broadband connection first. You may need to plug your computer into your DSL or cable internet box directly for this step. DO NOT plug the router's power cord into the wall just yet.\n\n* Using an Ethernet cable (a short piece should have come with your DSL/cable modem, your router or both), connect the DSL/cable modem to your router's WAN/Internet port. It may also be labeled DSL or Cable -- whatever, it's the one for the internet. When in doubt, check your router's manual. If it's a consumer router like the Linksys I recommended it will probably say Internet.\n\n* Now you can plug in the router's power cord. Some lights should start blinking. This is a good sign. Usually a router that's connected properly will have all green lights, mostly burning steadily but with some blinking.\n\n* If you are setting up a wired network, plug your computer into one of the open ports on the back of the router. Then (if you're on Windows) restart your computer. When it comes back you should be online. Check Google. If you can't get to Google, you're not online. Call tech support.\n\n* If you are setting up a wireless network, go to whatever screen or tool you normally use to connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot. Mac users, this would be the AirPort icon (the one that looks like radio waves) in the menu bar at the upper right corner of your screen. Windows XP users, this would be in your Network and Internet Connections screen, which is in the Control Panel. You should see at least one available hotspot, one of which is a gobbledygook of letters and numbers starting with LINKSYS. This is most likely your router. Select it and connect to it.\n\n* In a web browser, go to http://192.168.1.1/. If you're prompted for a username and password, congratulations, you're connected. You can cancel, or you can follow the instructions that came with your router to log in and give that puppy a more interesting name. Like \"Steve.\""

    title: "Scalability is for Wal-Mart"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I certainly don't appreciate it when a service I rely on _and pay for_ goes down regularly and without warning, but I can acknowledge that it's not the end of the world if I have to jot something down on paper and wait 30 minutes before I Backpack it."
    body: "Over at [Signal vs. Noise](http://www.37signals.com/svn/), [David](http://loudthinking.com/) has a very interesting, [very pragmatic take on the dreaded topic of uptime](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/dont_scale_99999_uptime_is_for_walmart.php) in this new web 2.0 era:\n\n> Jeremy Wright [purports a common misconception](http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/12/05/web-20-companies-need-to-scale/) about new companies doing business online: That you need 99.999% uptime or you&rsquo;re toast. Not so. Basecamp doesn&rsquo;t have that. I think our uptime is more like 98% or 99%. Guess what, we&rsquo;re still here!\n\n> If you&rsquo;re Wal-Mart and your credit card processing pipeline stops for 30 minutes during prime time, yes, the world does end. Someone might very well be fired...Now what if Delicious, Feedster, or Technorati goes down for 30 minutes? How big is the inconvenience of not being able to get to your tagged bookmarks or do yet another ego-search with Feedster or Technorati for 30 minutes? Not that high. The world does not come to an end. Nobody gets fired.\n\n> Om Malik thinks that the running-with-scissors approach of most start-ups is [a sign of a bubble](http://gigaom.com/2005/12/06/even-in-web-20-scale-size-matter/). Awahh? The bubble was when people thought they needed to spend \$3 million dollars buying Sun servers and Oracle databases to build a site for wedding invitations.\n\nThis is especially relevant given our recent server troubles here at Practicalmadness, but [as I finally realized before deciding to stick with TextDrive](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/12/textdrive_beat_me_but_i_love_t) being the maker of a site and one of its users are totally different perspectives. I certainly don't appreciate it when a service I rely on _and pay for_ goes down regularly and without warning, but I can acknowledge that it's not the end of the world if I have to jot something down on paper and wait 30 minutes before I Backpack it.\n\nI extended my quotation from David's post to the bit about wedding invitations for a reason. [I started working on Cmere](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/11/my_birthday_invite_it_lives), our upcoming event planning/announcements web app, after I realized that if I wanted to have a place online to send and receive invitations for my housewarming party I really had no choice but to use Evite, which I think is exemplary of those sites that (during the Bubble in the late '90s) burned through millions of dollars so you could buy pet food online. I don't think Evite's user experience is horrible, but it can be made much better and I have an idea or two about how to accomplish that.\n\nDo I have \$30M or a spare Sun server laying around? Am I using a Microsoft application framework backed by an enterprise database solution? No, but I have access to open source application frameworks, backed by free, open source databases, running (for now, at least) on month-to-month shared hosting. My total annual cost to run my websites is less than a thousand dollars; the only difference between me and Evite is that I will almost certainly have less uptime. But seriously: I think we can all handle it if my _invites site_ is down for 30 minutes, yes?"

    body: "There was, I thought, some killer gameplay on _Survivor_ this past week, made possible by some serious blunders by one of the stupidest guys ever to appear on this show. At the traditional Survivor Auction -- where the cast gets some money and gets to bid on food and other rewards -- Judd, the New York hotel doorman who reminds me of Fred Flintstone, pooled his money with Cindy, the hot zookeeper(!) with the hot Tennessee accent, to buy an overnight family visit for himself and two others, while the other players had to spend the night in a different part of the jungle. Since Judd did the bidding, he got to choose which two others got the reward (and thereby, which three were going to be banished for the night). He chose Cindy (of course, because she helped pay for it) and Stephenie (his closest ally in the game).\n\nThese \"gift\" rewards are significant in _Survivor_ strategy not only because you can use them to buy favors -- \"I gave you a visit with your creepy identical twin sister, now I'd like you to vote with me to eliminate Jerkus\" -- but because they let you control who's talking to whom _for an entire day_. Were Judd a competent player, he'd have given it to one of the players not so loyal to him, so that (a) he could lessen the possibility that they would have a chance to talk and work out a strategy to vote him out and (b) they would be more willing to support him in the final vote to determine who wins the million-dollar prize. Meanwhile, Steph could have been at the other camp with the outcasts, at the very least gaining information and at best shoring up support for their voting bloc.\n\nInstead, the three players sent away for the night _did_ in fact talk about voting Judd off, and were able to work out a strategy whereby they were even able to convince Stephenie to vote against him, and Judd was eliminated in a 4-2 vote that was non-unanimous only because Cindy didn't get the memo.\n\nGranted, Judd was an idiot, but he did have a powerful game position. So what did Rafe, Lydia and Danni do right in order to vote him off?\n\n* They planted a seed in Steph's mind about Judd's lying and paranoia, but only enough to get a conversation about trust started, and then they sat back and let those seeds grow. They also stayed very aware of who knew what when and who was talking to whom, and thus were able to manage the flow of information.\n\n* They kept the debate framed: it's not about Judd's behavior versus Lydia's, it's about whether Judd can be trusted not to betray someone next week, when the numbers begin to work out to cut his own alliance loose. In this they were able to take advantage of Steph's own pride and paranoia -- mmm, that should be a Jane Austen book -- to turn her against Judd, demonstrating that they know their targets well enough to manipulate them effectively.\n\n* The conspirators were very careful to keep the counter-alliance loose and the tone civil, so it never felt like a power play (and so didn't come onto Judd's radar) and nobody involved in the plot was shown making promises they didn't intend to keep. They unified based on self-interest and the knowledge that whoever survives the _next_ Tribal Council is in the final four where it's truly anybody's game to win.\n\n* On the part of Lydia and Danni, the two alliance outsiders most in danger of elimination were it not for the plot, they did a great job of working to secure their own positions while maintaining the appearance that they were resigned to going home. So they managed to keep things totally quiet long enough to bring about yet another Tribal Council blindside."

    title: "TextDrive Beat Me, But I Love Them Anyway"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I have won the victory over myself: I've decided to stick with TextDrive for the time being. Nothing I'm hosting is as they say mission-critical, my server enjoys about 95-96% uptime and I can live with that. However..."
    body: "I have won the victory over myself: this is the last thing I thought I'd be doing about my hosting situation, but I've decided to stick with TextDrive for the time being. Nothing I'm hosting is as they say mission-critical, and while I have certainly noticed the poor performance I'm not sure anyone else has noticed or cared. Sites go down sometimes, and my server enjoys about 95-96% uptime. I can live with that.\n\nSo as a generality, if you visit _practicalmadness.com_ it's there. It's only proven unreliable when I'm needing to make edits or use some other facilities like Subversion. So I'm moving my Subversion code repositories to another machine and keeping this one, because (as I wrote in an e-mail to some TextDrive staffers yesterday) when things are good, they are very, very, _very_ good. \n\nNow, I'll allow that for a web hosting provider, especially one that prides itself on performance and reliability, 96% uptime is inexcusably low. That's a loss of an entire business day, and if I were an online merchant it would mean an entire lost sales day. If I were more actively interested in meeting new clients via my website, that could be one or more lost contacts which could mean one or more lost contracts.\n\nI do, however, have some faith that the server admins are doing what they can for now, and given the choice between moving my personal site to less, shall we say, interesting hosting and sticking with the place that'll let me run the Oscars Game as a Rails app via lighttpd with minimal setup hassle, you better believe I'm sticking with, um, that last thing.\n\nThis is not to say that I don't think TextDrive can't do better, and I'm taking another unexpected (to me) step. Gandhi once said that you must be the change you wish to see in the world, a sentiment I believe in quite strongly, so rather than just grabbing my toys and sulking off the playground I've decided to get involved on the forums.\n\nMy reason for being a better forum neighbor than I have been is simply that I want to try to strike a balance between the die-hard TextDrive fans who can completely excuse any problem, and the customers who may love the service (or not) but who feel powerless against what's perceived as a geek clique. The perception, right or wrong, is that if you don't agree with the admins then they don't want you as a customer.\n\nI have read some forum posts that disturb me. Not the ones about that one jerk getting booted for verbally abusing admins; I can't fault that decision, as I chalk it up to Jason cutting his losses and sticking up for his team. If I couldn't also identify with the guy's frustration, I'd be pumping my fists and saying \"rock on, TextDrive admins!\"\n\nI'm more concerned with the posts where admins take all of this way, way too personally -- hosting is as much a business concern for us as it is for them, and the single primary thing I'd like to see from the admins is a greater acknowledgement that their so-far inability to keep the machines up has hurt us. An extra-long post on the status blog after Gilford crashed hard yesterday was a good step. I'd like to see even more transparency -- just let me know how my \$25 a month is being spent (and how it's actually the best goddamned bargain in hosting, given the amount of work that goes into providing it) and I can't complain. (Much.)\n\nBut the single most important thing is to keep the conversation civil, focused and open-minded. If I can help break the notion that TextDrive is for an el&iacute;te clique of open source programmers and no one else, then I'll have earned my cookie for the day.\n\n\n## Update ##\n\nJust checked the forums; TextDrive czar [Dean Allen](http://textism.com) is offering customers who host on Gilford the month of December for free. Just doing some quick, conservative math in my head, I can tell you that that is a _very_ expensive gesture for them to be making as a small company (even if they were [just acquired by Joyent](practicalmadness.com/2005/11/joyent_buys_textdrive)).\n\nAs demonstrated by my unwillingness to cut and run, TextDrive customers are loyal customers and (while this should not be taken to mean I'm not glad to be getting a free month) I think I'd have been satisfied with just the forum post by Dean. So thanks a bunch."

    title: "I Love the Smell of Iraq-Related News in the Morning"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "A sane person would acknowledge the reasons why we need to withdraw, but surely we can't be expect anything like sanity from our government, now can we?"
    body: "The Washington Post reports that [President Bush is expected to make a major speech about the Iraq war later this morning][wapo-bush], which _Slate_ columnist Fred Kaplan thinks may be [the sneaky groundwork for a withdrawal of U.S. forces.][slate]\n\n> The discombobulation begins Wednesday, when President George W. Bush is expected to proclaim...that the Iraqi security forces -- which only a few months ago were said to have just one battalion capable of fighting on its own -- have suddenly made uncanny progress in combat readiness. Expect soon after (if not during the speech itself) the thing that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have, just this month, denounced as near-treason -- a timetable for withdrawal of American troops.\n\n> And so it appears (assuming the forecasts about the speech are true) that the White House is as cynical about this war as its cynical critics have charged it with being. For several months now, many of these critics have predicted that, once the Iraqis passed their constitution and elected a new government, President Bush would declare his mission complete and begin to pull out -- this, despite his public pledge to \"stay the course\" until the insurgents were defeated.\n\nPerhaps part of that groundwork is being laid in articles like [this other one in the Post that quotes a Marine general as saying the U.S. is \"committed to withdrawing.\"][wapo2] I don't think the Defense department is in the habit of letting their soldiers talk about something the White House considers near-treasonous unless it's soon to become not-so-treasonous.\n\nMeanwhile, the L.A. Times is reporting that [the U.S. Military has been secretly paying Iraqi newspapers to publish stories written by American troops in an effort to burnish the image of the U.S. mission in Iraq.](latimes) Which shouldn't be that shocking given that [the Education Department paid a commentator to push No Child Left Behind][payola], but we're still talking about our government using the media to manipulate its citizens, which is creepy on so many levels.\n\nIt's also yet another instance of our government's right hand not knowing what it's State hand is doing: the paper reports that \"[this revelation] comes as the State Department is training Iraqi reporters in basic journalism skills and Western media ethics, including one workshop titled 'The Role of Press in a Democratic Society.'\"\n\nAnd so it seems the White House is letting the fiction of the war give way to...a different fiction of the war, which is that we did our job and it's time to leave. Still no acceptance of the reality, which is that we should never have been there, that they don't want us there, and we should cut and run. We're not accomplishing anything by staying. A sane person would acknowledge this, but surely we can't be expect anything like _sanity_ from our government, now can we?\n\n[wapo-bush]:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/30/AR2005113000164.html\n[wapo2]:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/29/AR2005112901850.html\n[slate]:http://www.slate.com/id/2131125/nav/tap2/\n[latimes]:http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-infowar30nov30,1,3365667.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&ctrack=1&cset=true\n[payola]:http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm"

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I'd imagine there'd be some kind of odious restrictions on even a cookie promotion, like I could only eat cookies during off-peak hours with an extra charge for leaving my local cookie-eating area. Damn, now I want cookies."
    body: "First it was announced that [SBC would be taking on the AT&T brand name][sbcatt], having recently completed the purchase of its former parent company. And now it's been announced that [Cingular Wireless, which is part owned by the former SBC, are looking to see what happens if they offer unlimited calls to AT&T landlines:][cnetatt]\n\n> The latest Cingular and AT&T option, dubbed Mobile2Home, will cost \$5.99 a month and it will only be available until February 25 to Connecticut customers who combine their AT&T local phone bill with their Cingular phone bill.\n\n> The concept is similar to unlimited mobile to mobile call packages that wireless operators including Cingular already sell, but AT&T said this would be the first package that combines traditional home phone and wireless services.\n\nSounds very exciting, except for the part about paying \$6 a month to use a wireless service I don't like to connect to [a telephone company I absolutely loathe][sbcpost].\n\nNow if they were to offer free unlimited AT&T cookies to Cingular customers, then I might be compelled to switch, but I'd imagine there'd be some kind of odious restrictions on even a cookie promotion. Like I could only eat cookies during off-peak hours with an extra charge for leaving my local cookie-eating area, unless I'm in the home of someone else who eats AT&T cookies. So I guess not even cookies can make me love SBC.\n\nDamn, now I want cookies.\n\n[sbcatt]:http://www.sbc.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=21906\n[cnetatt]:http://news.com.com/Cingular+tests+unlimited+calls+to+AT38T+home+phones/2100-1039_3-5976423.html?part=rss&tag=5976423&subj=news\n[sbcpost]:http://practicalmadness.com/2005/07/im_mad_as_hell_and_im_not_gonna_take_it_anymore"

    body: "This morning I'm going to try something new: a more \"old school\" form of blogging where I post a link with roughly a paragraph of commentary, with an eye towards quantity whilst of course maintaining my usual degree of quality. So not only do you get the suck, but you get more of it! Yay!\n\nAnd I may or may not decide later today to kill my budding credibility in the blogosphere by posting a \"why I love TextDrive\" essay. I've been doing _loads_ of research into them since the Joyent acquisition, and I'll be the first to admit two things:\n\n* Yes, I know I should have done this research _before_ I committed to give these guys \$25/month.\n\n* Even with the outages -- which I still think were avoidable -- theirs still just might be the best shared hosting platform out there for the types of sites that I wanna create.\n\nMeanwhile, you may have already noticed that the headers are, as promised, decked out for the Christmas holidays. Enjoy the festiveness, 'cause we're going right back to gray and green on December 26, for I am a cruel beast."

    description: "Wow, and I hadn't even noticed it was time for the November revision to the site. How quickly time flies."
    body: "Wow, and I hadn't even noticed it was time for the November revision to the site. How quickly time flies. What's new this week:\n\n* Comments are back by popular demand, where by \"popular\" I mean a couple of friends and a few fellow [disgruntled TextDrive customers.](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/11/the_great_hosting_company_bake). I'm not using any moderation, authentication or fancy web edu-ma-cation -- just comments backed by Movable Type's spam filter. If I end up with a bunch of comment spam I'll consider turning them off again, but until then, comment away. And yes, I know I promised Ajax-enabled comments at some point, but there wasn't a good way to work that magic in Movable Type without some substantial hacking. And really, who has the time? So I'm sorry, children, but you'll just have to live with a page refresh for the time being.\n\n* The tiny type I've been using becomes rather unpleasant to read on systems that don't have Mac OS X's killer text smoothing (i.e. Windows XP), so I've upped the font sizes and dropped the [37signals](http://37svn.com/)-style \"smooshed Helvetica\" on the headlines. The new Practical is a little less stylized, but more readable. I also fixed the 2-column layout on the \"find stuff\" section below the blog.\n\n* I'll be posting a Christmas-themed logo real soon now -- maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but definitely before Friday, which means it will probably be on Thursday, begging the question of why I couldn't just say I'll be updating the logo on Thursday. Well, you see, if I said I'd do it on Thursday I would forget and end up doing it early on Saturday, then futz with it until Monday, and in the meantime not a single person besides myself would notice or care about my struggle to bring you a more festive logo, until one day (probably late next week) one of you looks up and says, \"hey! The background up there is red and has spots on it! That's cute!\" Then goes about your business. The bottom line is: the Christmas season will have to wait until Thursday. (If not before.)\n\nNow, onto some (slightly) more somber business: due to the hosting company shakeup (which might not actually be a shakeup, we shall have to see) my [birthday party invitation](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/11/my_birthday_invite_it_lives) which was the first test of my upcoming web app C'mere is offline. The domain is at one company, the code's at another and everybody who's coming ended up telling me either in person or via e-mail, so perhaps I need to rethink my concept here. If you received a C'mere invite last week and still need to respond, just reply to the e-mail."

    title: "Joyent Buys TextDrive"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The friend of my enemy is...my enemy? I'm so confused."
    body: "[Joyent has acquired TextDrive](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-28-2005/0004223577), and now I don't know _what_ to think.\n\nAs regards TextDrive, on the one hand they're an innovative, capable hosting company that nevertheless allowed their shared hosting servers to suffer almost daily outages from August through November. On the other hand, they're innovative, capable, and I'm happy with the service apart from the whole \"server unavailable at the most inconvenient times\" thing. I'm really confused why we had to wait for a buyout to [see this on the TextDrive site](http://www.textdrive.com/hosting/shared):\n\n> Please note, TextDrive does not allow our shared servers to be used for web application development, testing or tweaking. These are production servers, to be used for tested, stable web applications only.\n\nAnd as for Joyent, on the one hand they're a web 2.0 startup with a hot, _hot_ product for idiot-proof groupware but no track record to speak of. But on the other hand they've got [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), of whom I am an outspoken fan.\n\nThe way I want to interpret this announcement: with the added Rails development muscle coming from new corporate parent Joyent, TxD will be able to _finish_ a few things, such as TextPanel and RailsBase, and make them even better than if TextDrive remained an independent company with 40+ servers and hundreds of customers whining about wanting to use `daedalus.rb`.\n\nWhen I called those products vaporware -- and by the way, I did see that referer from an internal site, guys, and I hope you'll concede that to an outside observer they sure do _look_ like vaporware -- I was of course looking at the endless cycle of unfulfilled promises. [Strongspace](http://strongspace.com/) is great, and I'm sure TextPanel and RailsBase will be as good if not better, but a _lot_ of people signed up for TextDrive shared hosting accounts as something to tide them over until RailsAppHosting/RailsBase was ready, and we're all still waiting.\n\nIf this announcement means that the TextDrive admins are handing the software development responsibilities over to someone else so they can pay closer attention to their hosting customers, then they'll have regained my respect. I may not be very credible saying this, but I do think the TextDrive guys have some smart ideas about hosting, and if they can keep the servers running then I look forward to seeing those ideas turn into products.\n\n\n## I'm Nine Miles Of Bad Road\n\nI'll be the first to concede that I'm extraordinarily picky when it comes to hosting companies. I really do want it all -- a great set of developer tools with excellent customer service and perfect uptime -- but the most important one to me is the customer service. It's not enough to demonstrate that you're aware of a problem or capable of solving it -- you've got to reassure your customers that whatever their problem is, it's on the radar.\n\nThe TextDrive guys are knowledgeable and super-aware of what's going on, but I've read too many forum postings from those guys that reduce the reliability problems to \"some moron on Gilford.\" I read too many posts by admins bitching about how `daedalus.rb` kills servers while waiting for them to show some backbone and actively prevent its use on their machines, a step that was finally taken on Thanksgiving. (And I'll grant you: Gilford has been _extremely_ well-behaved since Thanksgiving, although I'm still wondering why this didn't happen in August.)\n\nSo I am _not_ cancelling my TextDrive account just yet, because Joyent plus TextDrive is a very, _very_ interesting combination and I'm curious to see what happens next."

I did notice that they've started saying \"sorry for the inconvenience\" on status blog posts, which is nice."

    description: "However, though the book was published in July Rails 1.0 _still_ isn't finished and in the interim some changes were made to some testing defaults that made it a tiny challenge to get my tests to even work. Yes, sir, I unit test -- don't you?"
    body: "Last night I tried [Rails's][ror] built-in testing, and I'm like, _niiiice_. I basically was able to verify that every bit of business logic for C'mere works, then refactor a whole bunch of code into a cleaner, more powerful Event model, and then make sure that my refactoring didn't break anything. Of course, this doesn't do anything to stop me from endlessly fussing with the design, screen flow and buzzword compliance (\"more Ajax! More cowbell!\"), but it gives me another nerd metric against which to measure my penis. Yes, sir, I unit test -- don't you?\n\nI've been learning the Rails testing API via [the Pragmatic Programmers book][railsbook], which was intended to be -- in sync with the Rails 1.0 specification. However, though the book was published in July Rails 1.0 _still_ isn't finished and in the interim some changes were made to some testing defaults that made it a tiny challenge to get my tests to even work. They're not bad changes, but I had to go scrambling for guidance. And I think this highlights an ongoing gripe I have with the state of documentation for Rails.\n\nThere's lots of API documentation, sure, and how-tos and manuals posted to a Wiki. But wikis are almost by their nature unfocused (call me a stickler, but I'm not a fan of any medium where you can post a \"stub\" for public viewing), and API documentation doesn't help you see the forest for the trees. Rails is a full-stack framework, and there are sometimes instances where the information you need is neither a hand-holding tutorial nor a dry list of methods, parameters and effects.\n\nRails is an evolving API, but there's no reason why the community can't be as involved in creating learning resources that evolve along with that API, with a commitment to keeping them in sync.\n\n[ror]:http://www.rubyonrails.com/\n[railsbook]:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/097669400X/demareesworld"

    title: "The Great Hosting Company Bake-Off"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "It's said that those who can't do teach; perhaps when it comes to web developers, those who can't do host."
    body: "I've had some form of \"TextDrive sucks\" post in the hopper for over a month, ever since the Great Uptime Apocalypse of August 2005 in which my server went down for over an hour on nine out of eleven consecutive days. TextDrive offers some killer tools, but in terms of customer service and reliability they are unequivically the worst hosting company I've used. [This post on al3x.net seems to hit all the major points](http://www.al3x.net/articles/2005/10/06/web-hosting-is-a-losing-proposition). \n\nMy own primary gripes:\n\n* For a company that's home to a number of cool, innovative software developers, they have an awfully brute-force solution to their reliability problems, which is to fine and/or fire users who bring down the system. I've not faced this myself, fortunately, but as anyone who's studied the war on drugs can tell you, you can't fix a social problem simply by making the punishments harder.\n\n* TxD admins continue to recommend that customers sick of their policy of letting shitty Rails developers continue to bring down servers wait for their vaporware RailsBase product, which is billed as sort of a turnkey all-in-one development-production-shared-cluster(fuck). I'm not saying that RailsBase, aka RailsAppHosting, doesn't exist, it's just not here yet, and I shouldn't have to explain that a solution no one can see is not a solution. Yet it comes up at least once a day on the TextDrive forums and elsewhere as the silver bullet that will make TxD's shared hosting tolerable again. I'm sorry, I'd agree with you if you were right.\n\n* And those admins? Arrogant as hell. Guys: it's not enough to know how to fix the problems -- you've got to actually fix some at some point. I've begun to see TxD's _laissez faire_ atmosphere as not so much a feature as a bug, yet another symptom of the TextDrive crew being asleep at the switch. One of the things that drew me to TextDrive was the promise of being on a hosting company actively involved in developing its own user-friendly management tools, like the also-vaporous TextPanel. This has only resulted in a situation where pet projects like [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) and [Strongspace](http://strongspace.com/) enjoy unlimited resources and perfect uptime on dedicated boxes, while the shared hosting customers generally get screwed.\n\nSo as mentioned earlier today, I'm considering switching hosting companies for the fourth time in two years. I swear, I'm not that picky, but each of the companies I've hosted with since the end of '03 has been too expensive, not offered the features I want or (in the sole case of TextDrive) had poor customer service. It's looking like [Planet Argon](http://planetargon.com/) is going to be the way to go -- the founder is writing a Rails book for O'Reilly, they're staffed by Rails developers, and the word on the internets is pretty good.\n\nSo far my best hosting experience has been with Tilted Planet: they offered none of the server gadgetry I'm now used to, and were the most expensive host I've used. But their customer service was _phenomenal._ Pair Networks (who hosted the site from Nov '04 through July '05) was also pretty good, but the service wasn't as nice as Tilted and the value wasn't as good as TextDrive.\n\nI might even look into going the dedicated server route, just to ensure that my sites do what I want them to do. But whatever happens, I'm just about fed up with trusting my pet projects to a hosting operation that's treated like an afterthought. It's said that those who can't do teach; perhaps when it comes to web developers, those who can't do _host_. I'm still waiting to meet the company that'll change my mind about that."

    title: "My Birthday Invite: It Lives"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I switched from BBEdit to TextMate, for christ's sake."
    body: "For about a month I've been actively developing a new event planning and invitations web app called C'mere. The concept is that it can handle making the guest list, tracking responses, sending invites via e-mail, etc. And my plan was to have it more or less functional for a first little test today: [sending my birthday party invites.][invite]\n\nAnd by gum -- I did it. I basically taught myself a number of software development best practices (for example, C'mere is my first project I've been regularly backing up to a Subversion repository, which is an ironclad lockbox for code), set up my first lighttpd server and installed [Rails][rails] development environments on three separate computers so I would have all the tools I needed to get this thing functional, if not 100% ready for prime time. I switched from BBEdit to TextMate, for christ's sake.\n\nLo and behold, my project hit two last-minute snags:\n\n* It turns out that e-mail templates and web page templates in Rails don't always get along. For some recipients of the first C'mere invite the message was plain, unstyled HTML. For others, it was a messed-up version of the event's web page. And I'm hearing some reports that it didn't come through at all. (If you got a mysterious blank or unstyled e-mail from me this morning, you're probably invited to the party. [Click here to view the invite and respond.][invite])\n\n* TextDrive, my hosting company for Rails projects (as well as this blog), chose this morning to have another of their charming little outages. The TextDrive people didn't post a system status warning, but there was definitely a period of at least an hour when all my sites hosted with them were inaccessible. So I'm looking at switching, possibly to Planet Argon, which (if it's a good fit) would be cheaper and hopefully easier to manage.\n\nAs for C'mere, well, the version I posted this morning is but a taste of the glory to come. I've got a number of features planned that should make it quite an interesting, simple alternative to sites like Evite. Unfortunately this means that I probably won't make my original self-imposed New Years deadline, but I'm not sweating it (yet). Better to make it good than to bear the disappointment of telling the world they should send their New Years party invites on software that crashes, right? \n\n[invite]:http://dev.cmere.net/af84a05b890e19a9\n[rails]:http://www.rubyonrails.com/"

    title: "Boxed Wine for the Fancy"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Especially since it's something way cooler than boxed wine: wine in a tube."
    body: "<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2005/11/09/dining/09tube.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border:0\" align=\"right\" /> The New York Times this morning reports on a remarkable breakthrough in the culture war, almost as stunning as if Susan Sontag became a huge NASCAR fan, as [chef Daniel Boulud, his wine executive Daniel Johnnes and vintner Dominique Lafon are test-marketing _a boxed wine_ called Dtour.][1]\n\n>  \"People see boxed wine as trashy, so we're trying to break away from that image,\" said Mr. Johnnes...To combat the stigma surrounding boxed wine, they packaged theirs in squat cardboard cylinders instead. Mr. Boulud admitted that it may look like a gimmick, but said it's great technology. The vacuum-sealed bag protects the wine from oxidation, he said, so the last glass should taste as good as the first, even if it's poured a month later. \"On downtime, people want just a small glass,\" without the pressure of finishing an entire bottle before it goes bad, the chef said.\n\n> At a tasting from a tube that was opened two weeks previously and stored in Mr. Johnnes's refrigerator, the wine tasted light and lively - a good everyday white with appreciable citrus notes. In the nose and on the tongue, it was a brighter rendition of the same wine Mr. Johnnes poured from a bottle he had hauled back from France and popped open just moments before.\n\nEasy cracks about boxed wines notwithstanding -- and perhaps this is just my attraction to anything bright red and gadgety -- I want one. Especially since it's not _really_ a boxed wine. No, no, no -- this is something way cooler: wine in a _tube_. And to go with it we'll need some artisanal cheesemaker somewhere to come up with a _tube_ of fine cheese, like maybe a chevre. Crackers already come in a tube-shaped wrapper, but for this we'll need to find a cracker where the cardboard packaging is also a tube, lest we be forced to serve fine goat cheese on Pringles. \n\nAs for their choice of a debut wine: I'll take the chardonnay, but it is my hope that this turns out successful enough for Dtour to not only be available in my neighborhood Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, but to expand to some red wines. The article goes on to say that they are working on \"a red\" for the 2005 vintage, but specifically, I want a Syrah/Shiraz or (better yet) a Pinot Noir.\n\n[1]:http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/dining/09tube.html"

    title: "Usability Is About Sensible Defaults"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "And if I'm wrong it's easy to correct me."
    body: "Around the office I find myself using the phrase \"expected behavior\" a lot. Now, I'm largely self-taught when it comes to human interface design and making websites and applications accessible and usable to non-geeks, so I apologize if any of the following seems obvious to any _actual designers_ who may be reading this, but a lot of the design choices I make revolve around two questions:\n\n1. What does the user expect to accomplish on this screen/by clicking this button/by looking at this?\n2. What is the _shortest and clearest_ path (in clicks or keystrokes) to meeting that objective?\n\nLooking closely at question 1, note that I use the term \"expect.\" For me perfect usability is all about being able to look at a tool, infer its purpose and immediately understand what action you need to take to get it to do what you want. Situations are never entirely perfect, of course, and a designer must always be prepared to accept that some people using the product will be confused. So the object isn't to aspire to some theoretical ideal of usability or efficiency, but simply to mitigate the user's expectations as best you can.\n\nTo illustrate what I'm on about, I present to you -- for the first time ever outside of my own web browser -- a screen from [my upcoming event announcements app, C'mere][1].\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"cmere-defaults.gif\" src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/11/cmere-defaults.gif\" width=\"479\" height=\"222\" /></p>\n\nIn C'mere everything revolves around events (to which you invite people _a la_ Evite), and the form widget you're seeing sets the date and time for a new event. I usually hate drop-down menus because they require at least two clicks to make a single choice. Here, setting the date and time involves making up to eight choices, which if you had to change every single field would mean sixteen clicks just to tell C'mere that your event starts at eight-thirty in the evening on December 3rd.\n\nTo make the site as powerful and flexible as I want it to be, I need all eight data points here, and I need them to be in drop-downs to guarantee that they're in a format my software can handle. So to make the site as usable as possible for a large number of people, I'm relying on _sensible default settings_ to help smooth the way.\n\nTo go step by step:\n\n* The time zone field can be set to any time zone in the world -- dozens of possible choices. However, I'm expecting that most C'mere users (especially for the public beta) will be in the United States, and many of those will be right here in the Central time zone. So the U.S. time zones are at the top of the list, and Central is the default. If you need to change to a different zone, it's easy to find a likely correct option.\n\n* On almost every field of every form on the site, there's some explanatory text at left to help people figure things out. It sets the context and expectations for a given series of options so you can make an informed choice quickly. I know we're just talking about _the time_ here, but people can get confused if they don't know what these time options are _for_. Here I recommend that events be created at least five calendar days beforehand, and I offer that as the default date. If that's not the right day, you can quickly and easily change it.\n\n* Rather than set the time menus to midnight or the current server time -- both common defaults -- I tried to choose a time that would be a sensible default for when an event would start. Here I'm just making a guess that a large number of events would start at 7 PM, but I think it's a fair guess. And so long as an event is in the evening or afternoon, the correct hour is nearby. I also don't think it's an unfair guess that events would start at the top of the hour, but if I'm wrong it's easy to correct me.\n\n* Databases want everything specified, but humans often think in relative terms, especially when we're talking about events in the future. So rather than ask for a specific ending time, I ask what I think is a more apt question: how long is your event? Is it an hour? Two hours? Never? I think that people planning an event would have to think for a second to remember their end time, but could easily say their party will probably be four hours long. In the software the result is the same -- it takes that choice and computes an ending time by adding that value to the start time. That's the sort of mental labor I'd rather subject my computers to, rather than my customers.\n\n[1]: http://cmere.net/"

    body: "If you're anywhere within four blocks and downwind you can smell it: the aroma of _delicious chocolate_ wafting from the Blommer Chocolate factory on Kinzie Street. But now [the EPA has accused Blommer of violating federal air pollution guidelines][1] by making the air downtown a little more choco-tastic:\n\n> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent an inspector to check out the factory after a neighbor complained about the aroma of burnt chocolate. Based on what the inspector saw...the EPA cited Blommer on Thursday for violating limits on opacity, or the amount of light blocked by the factory's grinder dust...Environmental regulators measure opacity to help determine if factories are releasing too much pollution that can trigger asthma attacks and harm people suffering from heart and lung diseases--whether those tiny particles are soot from a power plant or cocoa dust from a candy grinder.\n\n> But the EPA rarely cites companies just for violating the limits. The agency's decision to take action against Blommer comes amid repeated complaints that the agency has failed to address opacity violations at coal-fired power plants in the Chicago area...\"Everyone has to comply with the same rules, but why is it that time after time these coal plants get a free pass?\" said Bruce Nilles, a Midwest representative of the Sierra Club.\n\nSo coal dust is okay, but chocolate is bad? Something tells me the Hershey people forgot to pay their lobbyists this month.\n\n[1]:http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0511040117nov04,1,4673483.story?coll=chi-news-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true (Chicago Tribune: EPA not cuckoo for cocoa powder)"

    title: "Louisiana Owes FEMA Billions (With a B) of Dollars"

    description: "Another headline I considered: \"FEMA to Ravaged Louisiana: Pay Up, Bitches.\""
    body: "Another headline I considered: \"FEMA to Ravaged Louisiana: Pay Up, Bitches,\" although when you look past the headline this seems almost reasonable, or at least much less an issue of our demonstrably corrupt central government sticking it to a flood-ravaged, less demonstrably corrupt local government.\n\n> Federal law requires state and local governments to pay a portion of disaster relief costs. That share can be as much as 25%. The \$3.7 billion estimate is roughly 9% of FEMA's projected costs in Louisiana...The \$3.7 billion represents just under half of the \$8 billion the state spends per year and comes as the extensive flooding around New Orleans has severely undercut tax revenue.\n\nBecause of the way this law is structured, to forgive this debt requires that legislation be passed in Congress to do so on a case by case basis. And as acknowledged in the article via quotes from former FEMA staffers now working as consultants advising Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco on disaster recovery, Katrina-Rita is a completely unprecedented situation -- the law as written was never intended to cover such a huge and costly national disaster.\n\nI would like to say I have confidence that our lawmakers will quickly take some action to reassure people in the areas hit by Katrina and Rita that we're not going to bankrupt entire states because some federal statute failed to anticipate that we would get caught with our pants down as a hurricane completely destroyed the city of New Orleans. However I should not have to remind you that the United States is the only First World nation where people's economic lives are routinely ruined by defaulting on medical bills, and I can easily imagine certain voices in our government being like, \"whatcher problem? We gave you \$26,000 for your house and all your possessions -- you made out like bandits on this whole thing.\"\n\n[1]:http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20051104/1a_lede04_dom.art.htm (USA Today article on Louisiana's \$3.7B USD debt to FEMA)"

    body: "Washington Post: [CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons.][1]\n\nI shouldn't even have to comment on this -- I don't know about you, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to defend the American ideals of liberty, democracy and delicious free markets by setting up _gulags_.\n\nEspecially if -- as the article states -- this CIA \"black site\" system that was designed only to hold the most powerful, most potentially useful prisoners while \"ordinary\" enemy combatants were relegated to the military has stopped filtering itself, and the only thing deciding whether a given terror suspect is sent to Gitmo (where they now have at least some useful oversight) or sent into purgatory is whether they're unlucky enough to get picked up by the CIA rather than the Army.\n\nIn fairness, I don't know if we can call these gulags -- as far as I know people at least knew where the gulags _were_, even if to be sent there meant one was most likely never to be seen again.\n\nI do apologize, Dear Readers, for the steady diet of political coverage (broken up only by [my shock about Jeff Probst leaving _Survivor_][2]) but come on: one week ago [Harriet Miers withdrew from her Supreme Court nomination][5], and since then the hits just keep on coming: [Scootergate][4], Alito, [Harry Reid's closed session.][3] If it weren't for this hard callus of cynicism I'd think this week was somehow historic.

    body: "So apparently we have an opposition party in this country! What a concept! [CNN is reporting that the Democrats have forced the Senate into a closed session to discuss the Iraq War and the indictment of Scooter Libby][3]; all 100 Senators have been required to drop whatever they're doing and lock themselves inside the Senate chambers. From the blogosphere:\n\n> The Democrats have forced the Senate into a closed session, to shut down the Senate and go behind closed doors for national security reasons, in order to discuss what the hell happened with Rove and ScooterGate.\n\n> Holy shit. CNN just said that by invoking Rule 21, Reid just shut down the Senate, all 100 Senators are called to the Senate floor, they have to turn over their cell phones, blackberries, etc.\n\n> And Frist is PISSED. I have never been slapped in the face to this degree. Boo hoo hoo. Frist wants to talk about stunts? His entire leadership is a stunt. There has been no congressional oversight of the Bush administration for five years while the Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress.\n\n> And the real big news. This just knocked Judge Alito off his game. The story is now the Democrats showing balls on national security. Reid just changed the subject from Judge Alito to the White House's scandals on Iraq and the RoveGate CIA leaks. Absolutely brilliant. (AmericaBlog[1], via [Atrios][2])\n\nI think the above blog entry's being a bit more optimistic about how much impact this might have -- the Republicans are already painting this as nothing more than a tantrum by irresponsible Democrats -- but remember that this is the same Harry Reid who was characterized in a New Yorker profile last summer as even-tempered (at least politically), moderate and conciliatory towards the Right. If he and the Democratic leadership are willing to pull the Senate away from their golf games, you _know_ they've had enough.\n\n[1]:http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/11/holy-shit-put-on-cnn.html\n[2]:http://atrios.blogspot.com/\n[3]:http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/01/senate.iraq.ap/index.html"

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "We need strong leadership in government who will work to pass and enforce a Meat'normous Anti-Proliferation Act so that I can be protected from my own quest for novelty."
    body: "If you're looking to understand the culture war between us latt&eacute;-guzzling liberals and the honest, hardworking rubes in the red states, but don't want to bring up racism, labor, abortion, religion, politics or anything that's a possible downer, let us look at the issue by way of food. Take this [interview in the _New York Times Magazine_ with former President George H.W. Bush's personal chef, Ariel de Guzman:][1]\n\n> **It doesn't sound as if the Bushes believe in dieting.**   \nNo. It's a personal choice. I think we're too conscious about what we see and what we read in the newspaper, rather than thinking for our own.\n\n> **Well, President Bush the elder has been a voice of antinutrition ever since he declared his dislike of broccoli.**   \nIt's not only broccoli, but we are also talking about brussels sprouts, alfalfa and cabbage and anything that does not have a good smell.\n\n> **Is that why some of your recipes call for canned vegetables?**   \nAs far as nutrition is concerned, canned or frozen vegetables have more nutrition than fresh vegetables. It's added from the companies, the manufacturer.\n\n> **You can't possibly see yourself as a serious cook.**   \nNo, ma'am, not at all. I wouldn't know what fresh saffron looks like. I'm not into research.\n\nIn other words, if you don't hate freedom, you cook and eat like a lazy 25-year-old male (not that I would know anything about that), whereas when you eat salads and foods that taste like something other than ADM-produced chemical sludge you're riding with Communism. _Of course_ that's not what this article says or is about; I'm just pointing out a cultural difference that explains why, in a just universe, there can be such a thing as the Burger King Meat'normous Omelet Sandwich.\n\nSpeaking of which, out of sheer boredom I set out to order one of those yesterday morning, but upon reaching Burger King chickened out and ordered the Enormous Omelet one instead. (The difference is that the Enormous Omelet has bacon and sausage, whereas the _Meat'normous_ Omelet also has ham and extra cheese.) That daring culinary experience has sworn me off eggs, breakfast meats, cheeses, bread and most solid food for at least a week. Which is also telling, I think: in a just universe where there can be such a thing as the Meat'normous Omelet Sandwich, we need strong leadership in government who will work to pass and enforce a Meat'normous Anti-Proliferation Act so that I can be protected from my own quest for novelty.\n\nPlease, Washington: our children's futures are at stake.\n\n[1]:http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30questions.html"

    body: "And the hits just keep on comin': [I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby was indicted today by the grand jury investigating the Valerie Plame affair](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/28/AR2005102800153.html?sub=AR), and will be resigning his position as the vice president's chief of staff. The other target of special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation, Bush consigliere Karl Rove, has been spared for now, but told that the investigation is not over and that further indictments may be handed down.\n\nLibby is indicted on one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements to a grand jury -- none of which assign blame for the leaking of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson's identity, but rather for lying about whether he knew she was covert and from whom he had learned of her true identity."
    extended: "For those hopelessly lost in this bit of political intrigue, the rough outline: the case for going to war in Iraq was built upon a claim, made by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address, that Iraq had attempted to purchase some uranium-enriched \"yellowcake\" from the African country of Niger. This claim was based on documents received from Italian intelligence agencies later revealed to be forgeries. \n\nFormer Ambassador Joseph Wilson -- Valerie Wilson's husband -- was sent to Niger to verify whether or not the \"yellowcake\" rumor was true, and he could find no proof that it was. Nevertheless, the U.S. continued to beat the drum calling for war against Iraq, and Wilson continued to say it was bupkes. Thus (it is believed) the Administration -- led by Libby, Rove and possibly Vice President Cheney -- arranged for Wilson's wife's identity to be revealed in the press, ruining her career and embarrassing the both of them.\n\nThe problem is: knowingly revealing the identity of a covert government agent is a federal crime, and such secrets are generally not available to even the most well-connected members of the press unless someone in power _wants_ them to be leaked. So someone in our government knew Plame was covert and decided to out her anyway, and in doing so not only committed a felony but may have done so with the knowledge, complicity or flat-out insistence of one or more top members of the Bush administration.\n\nJust to bring the significance of this into relief: Watergate was a politically motivated burglary (with some vandalism thrown in), but it didn't involve state secrets (and the identity of a covert CIA agent, regardless of that person's mission, is a state secret) or forged documents used to start a war or one government agency retaliating against another government agency. In terms of malfeasance, this is Watergate times ten. (Granted, Bush hasn't had his Saturday Night Massacre in this case yet, but then again nobody would ever accuse Dubya of having Nixon's balls.)\n\nI think that all of us, regardless of how we feel about the issues facing America today, can agree that leaking state secrets for petty revenge is a bad thing. So is lying to cover for the people what did the leaking."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "What bliss. Unless you're a Bush supporter, in which case I am truly sorry for the loss of your brain. It must be very hard for you."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/10/27miers2.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"263\" width=\"184\" alt=\"27miers2.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> This morning the White House has announced that [Pres. Bush has, with weeping in his heart, accepted Harriet Miers's request to step down from her nomination as a Supreme Court justice.][2] \"The wingers really took [Miers] out,\" say the folks at [Pandagon](http://pandagon.net/), \"though that first questionnaire gave both the left and the right enough ammo to make hearings a complete disaster for the Admin.\"\n\nAnd speaking of old gray ladies, here's what The New York _Times_ has to say:\n\n> In recent days, several prominent members of the Republican Party had begun to publicly question Ms. Miers's nomination, suggesting was not conservative enough on issues such as abortion. Others, including Democrats and Republicans, have questioned Ms. Miers's lack of judicial experience since her nomination was announced on Oct. 3.\n\n> Democratic senators had also sought White House documents from Ms. Miers, who is the White House counsel, that might have given clues to her judicial philosophy.\n\n> In a statement today, President Bush said he had \"reluctantly\" accepted her decision to withdraw. \"It is clear that senators would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents concerning advice provided during her tenure as the White House - disclosures that would undermine a president's ability to receive candid counsel,\" Mr. Bush said in the statement.\n\n> The president added: \"Harriet Miers' decision demonstrates her deep respect for this essential aspect of the constitutional separation of powers - and confirms my deep respect and admiration for her.\" ([The New York Times][5], Thu Oct 27 2005)\n\nWell, _that_ long national nightmare is finally over. I must say, I'm surprised by the timing -- in all likelihood [there will be indictments announced for one or more senior White House advisers today][4], so I'm not certain if the intent here is to deflect attention away from the withdrawal by letting it get buried by the _big_ story yet to break, or the other way 'round.

Not that there will be (much) violence, but, well, anything's possible on a night like tonight.\n\nI mean: Chicago won the World Series. I half expect a hurricane to form on Lake Michigan, or Jesus Christ himself to appear in Daley Plaza to kick off the Rapture.\n\nCongrats Sox!"

    title: "Sox Win Game 3 (And Chicago Says Yay)"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If they win tonight the Sox will bring home Chicago's first World Series title since 1917. And then there will be a riot on the South Side like you won't believe."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/10/sox-ws-05.gif\" alt=\"White Sox: Fair Weather and Proud\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> They totally lost me somewhere around the bottom of the 11th. Last night's [Game 3 of the World Series lasted well past midnight](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2005/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=2203945) as the White Sox and Astros fought to break a 5-5 tie. Finally, in the _14th inning_, the Sox managed 2 runs (thanks to a homer by Geoff Blum) to break the stalemate and win their third World Series game in a row. If they win tonight -- or any one of the four remaining games -- the Sox will bring home Chicago's first World Series title since 1917. And then there will be a riot on the South Side like you won't believe.\n\nFor me the experience of watching Game 3 followed this rough outline:\n\n* Dismissed my Dreamweaver class at Digital Bootcamp a few minutes early so people could catch the end of the game. Yeah, I figured -- people would get home just in time to catch the last couple innings and it would be fine. When I left Bootcamp, the 5-Run Fifth -- the _only_ inning in which the Sox scored until the tie-breaking homer in the, um, fourteenth -- hadn't happened yet. So as far as I knew we were getting beaten by the Astros 0-4 in the 4th.\n\n* Get home at about 10 PM, see the score on the Fox Sports Dashboard Widget and turn on the TV. \"Yay!\" says me. \"Hot time!\" says Bubs.\n\n* In the bottom of the eighth, the Astros manage a run to tie the score at 5-5. And as I recall, it's only because of some fast work by the Sox defense that they didn't manage two runs -- if they had, the Astros would have won and we wouldn't be talking about any crazy game-deciding home runs in the top of the _fourteenth_.\n\n* And thus begins _the stalemate_. Ninth inning: tied. Tenth inning: tied! _Eleventh inning: TIED!_ With Bobby Jenks -- the massive White Sox pitcher with the 100-mph fastball -- on the mound barely keeping Houston at bay, I fall asleep on the couch.\n\n* 1:25 am: I wake up and the game has _just_ ended, the White Sox have won 7-5 in the fourteenth, and I'm like _whaha?_\n\nSeriously -- I had to check the web this morning to make sure I hadn't dreamed it, because there were many aspects that were quite surreal, even if the overall picture lacked my usual dream signifiers of nonsensical architecture and lizards wearing cowboy hats and six-shooters."

    title: "Apple Website Celebrates Rosa Parks"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "It's a lovely gesture, I think, and a reminder that _sometimes_ Apple's attitude isn't just pretension."
    body: "<img src=\"http://images.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2005/10/rosaparks/images/rosa.jpeg\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" /> [Apple Computer's website pays tribute to the life of Rosa Parks][1] (who passed away Monday at age 92), \"whose act of civil disobedience in 1955 inspired the modern civil rights movement,\" [according to CNN][2].\n\n> Even to many people who were around in those days, the era of racial segregation seems as remote as the Civil War. You might say that back in the Fifties, American society lived at a different point in evolutionary time.\n\n> Social historians point to an individual act of defiance on December 1, 1955, as the beginning of the end of that time.\n\n> What happened: In Montgomery, Alabama, a black seamstress named Rosa Parks was heading home after a long day at work. She boarded a bus and found a vacant seat. Trouble was, if there weren&rsquo;t enough seats on the bus for Caucasians, African Americans were supposed to give up their seats; back then that was the law in Montgomery, Alabama. As it happened, the bus soon filled up and Rosa was expected to give up her seat.\n\n> Fat chance. The lady had had enough. Rosa Parks refused to budge. In short order, Mrs. Parks was arrested, fingerprinted and fined for violating a city ordinance.\n\n> That incident in Montgomery turned out to be a catalyst for change. Mrs. Parks&rsquo;s arrest resulted in a black boycott of the city&rsquo;s bus line&mdash;a boycott that ended 381 days later when the bus line caved in, on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation in transportation was unconstitutional. ([Apple.com][1])\n\nTogether with this page celebrating Parks's contribution to history, Apple changed the image on their home page (which otherwise would be hyping the new video iPods or Power Mac G5 Quad workstations) to a \"Think Different\" banner featuring her. (Which means [the brief return of the old Apple Garamond font][3], much to the excitement of some nerds on MacDevCenter.) It's a lovely gesture, I think, and a reminder that _sometimes_ Apple's attitude isn't just pretension.\n\n[1]:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2005/10/rosaparks/\n[2]:http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/10/24/parks.obit/\n[3]:http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8207?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550"

    title: "Good Night, Harriet Miers"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Our lame duck Administration's lame-o Supreme Court nomination is in trouble, and someone might actually have to answer for their role in the Valerie Plame affair. Why, it's almost like Christmas."
    body: "[Pandagon][1]'s got a choice quote for anyone wondering [how Harriet Miers feels about a woman's right to choose][2]:\n\n> 'Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers said in a speech more than a decade ago that 'self-determination' should guide decisions about abortion and school prayer and that in cases where scientific facts are disputed and religious beliefs vary, 'government should not act.'\n\n> In a 1993 speech to a Dallas women's group, Miers talked about abortion, the separation of church and state, and how the issues play out in the legal system. 'The underlying theme in most of these cases is the insistence of more self-determination,' she said. 'And the more I think about these issues, the more self-determination makes sense.' ([Washington Post][3] via [Pandagon][2])\n\nHonestly, I've never understood how so many conservatives were able to square social policy like bans on abortion or gay marriage with a small-government ethos, but then again I'm a (somewhat) liberal who can't say he understands how small government's supposed to work, so I'm probably not the person to ask.\n\nIn any event, you probably don't need me to tell you that the Miers nomination is in trouble. Said nomination is under attack from both left and right sides of the aisle, and both parties are furious at Miers and the White House's \"we don't have to tell you that\" stance on releasing _any_ information on her background or qualifications. But since she's one of the insiders Bush brought with him from Texas the most we can hope for is a withdrawal (accompanied by general bitching from the Administration), since the GOP, while distancing itself from Dubya, is still not free enough of the Karl Rove whammy to risk having to _vote against_ a Bush nominee.\n\nMeanwhile, indictments are expected later today in the Valerie Plame Wilson case  -- you know, that thing where the White House leaked the identity of an undercover CIA operative to retaliate against her husband's attempt to discredit the patently bogus intelligence used to justify the phony case for going to war in Iraq. \n\nWhy, it's almost like Christmas.\n\n[1]:http://www.pandagon.net/\n[2]:http://www.pandagon.net/archives/2005/10/it_was_nice_kno.html\n[3]:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/25/AR2005102502038.html"

    title: "Google Base: A Database For The Rest of Us?"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Apparently Google has a fiendish plan to make database servers accessible to the Rest of Us, as there are rumors on the internets about a new site/product called Google Base."
    body: "Apparently Google has a fiendish plan to make database servers accessible to the Rest of Us, as there are [rumors on the internets about a new site/product called Google Base][1].\n\n> **Post your items on Google.**\n\n> [Google Base][2] is Google&rsquo;s database into which you can add all types of content. We&rsquo;ll host your content and make it searchable online for free.\n\n> Examples of items you can find in Google Base:\n\n> * Description of your party planning service\n> * Articles on current events from your website\n> * Listing of your used car for sale\n> * Database of protein structures\n\n> You can describe any item you post with attributes, which will help people find it when they search Google Base. In fact, based on the relevance of your items, they may also be included in the main Google search index and other Google products like Froogle and Google Local.\n\nBrief aside: I've been very good about [sticking to non-opaque titles][3] on this blog, but do you have any idea how hard it was not to make an [\"all your base\"][4] joke up there?\n\nThis news seems to have some spirital connection to a recent development at [Odeo][5]: founder Evan Williams posted late last week about [podcasting as a form of direct communication from person to person][6], and gave as an example he and his girlfriend sending short audio clips back and forth, like little voicemails -- phone tag played on purpose.\n\nWell, yesterday I come home to find that Odeo has finally made their Create tools -- a collection of web- and phone-based apps for recording audio clips for your podcasts -- available to all existing users. Perhaps more significantly, they added a feature that lets you send audio clips to an e-mail address or make them available to your friends who are Odeo members, instead of posting them to a public podcast channel.\n\nThe thinking behind this? I can't speak for Google or for Odeo, obviously, but I think a lot of us online are shocked(!) by the success of a service like MySpace or [LiveJournal][7]. Even given access to some really sophisticated tools and the possibility of instant worldwide publication, most people (it would seem) will choose to use a more limited tool to create short bursts of content and publish them to their existing circles of family and friends.\n\nThat's the trend to pay attention to: people are coming online and creating new textual, audible and visual content like you ain't never seen, but are more interested in sharing it with their friends in the real world. It's not passive media consumption, like television or radio; the object here isn't to _add_ more information clutter, but rather to use technology to enhance and enrich our relationships. Seriously cool.\n\nGoogle Base (such as I've seen about it in these rumors) doesn't follow the communication idea as much, but it is about creating small bits of information rather than a monolithic web site. Most people honestly do not need a full web site or blog, but could use a way to post stuff online. The big difference with something like this is that it can do away with the linear aspect of a blog and present the same short bits of information structured in a way that makes most sense in context. And if Google Bases are easily shareable, with controls on who can see what, then it _does_ meet my criteria for social software and could be seriously useful.\n\nI'm interested to see how this shakes out.\n\n**Updated:**  \n[Google Base][2] is belong to us: the site seems to be consistently working, except that it doesn't yet appear to be linked into the Google Accounts login system so one can't _actually_ post an item yet, but they can try the thing out. A few things about it:\n\n* While you're given a choice of about a dozen item \"templates\" (like \"Person Profile\"), you can also create a totally unique item. The create form is done with Ajax and is a little clunky design-wise but generally functional and usable.\n\n* Items are posted for no more than 31 days, and can be set to expire sooner than that. It would seem that the main objective of adding something to the Base is to be able to post something little like an address or an event for short-term use, as opposed to something permanent that would necessitate an actual website. This also prevents sneaky buggers like myself from using Base as their permanent database server.\n\n* Because Google Base are not belong to Google Accounts just yet, there's no way to know if items can be shared with anyone but the whole damned world.\n\n* Speaking of Google Accounts, I just noticed that you can use your Google Account to log into Orkut, Google's ultra-exclusive social networking site. However, while your Google Account will allow you to log into your Orkut account, having a Google Account does not give you an Orkut account. If you want to get into Orkut, you still have to be invited by an existing member.\n\n\n[1]:http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-10-25-n57.html\n[2]:http://base.google.com/\n[3]:http://practicalmadness.com/2005/10/post_titles_or_my_opacity_problem\n[4]:http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us\n[5]:http://odeo.com/\n[6]:http://odeo.com/blog/2005/10/podcasting-for-regular-people.html\n[7]:http://sixapart.com/livejournal/"

    title: "America's Next Top...Muppet?!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If you want to mix in some \"Top Model\" and have a Janice Dickinson on the panel, I have only one word for you: Gonzo."
    body: "OMFG. There are rumors on the internets that [ABC will relaunch the Muppets with _a reality TV parody_][1] where a panel of Muppet judges audition a bunch of Muppet hopefuls in search of _america's next top Muppet_.\n\n> ABC has ordered a script and five script outlines for \"America's Next Muppet,\" a reality TV parody in which viewers may actually get a chance to pick Kermit and Miss Piggy's latest colleague.\n\n> ABC and Disney remain tight-lipped on the project, although word of the project first leaked last month to several Muppets fan Web sites. But it appears that the new Muppet project would borrow from shows like \"American Idol\" and \"America's Next Top Model\" as judges (Kermit? Statler and Waldorf? Animal?) comb through several new characters to select a major Muppet. ([Variety][1] via [AICN][2])\n\nRight now I have a sheet of Muppets postage stamps on my desk that I plan to use for all my correspondence. Rent check? Muppet! Credit card bills? Muppet! Letters to old girlfriends and distant family members? MUPPETS!\n\nMy question is: assuming that one of the shows they're looking to parody is _American Idol_, which Muppet is which real person? I'm thinking Kermit would fill the Ryan Seacrest role -- he's better suited to being the MC than to being a colorful, lovable judge on one of these shows. Miss Piggy is definitely Paula Abdul, and you could probably fit Fozzie into the Randy Jackson role. And if you want to mix in some _Top Model_ and have a Janice Dickinson on the panel, I have only one word for you: Gonzo. \n\nCelebrity guest panelists would be (of course) celebrity guest panelists, because the Muppets are never cooler than when you see them next to a real live celebrity and realize how this person, however hot they are, will _never_ be as cool as a Muppet.\n\nThis leaves only one seat to fill: Simon. What Muppet could possibly be acid enough, and cool enough, to be the Muppet world's response to Simon Cowell? Statler & Waldorf and Oscar the Grouch spring to mind, but they're not leading Muppets and I would hope that part of the parody element in making a Muppets reality show would be the acknowledgement that we do in fact tune in just to watch the judges. Carolyn, after all, is our co-pilot.\n\nSo I think a Muppet reality show would be pretty cool, and an acceptable alternative to what would be truly awesome and so of course could never happen: giving Kermit his own late-night talk show. Come on, who would you rather watch: a Muppet, or Jimmy Kimmel?\n\n[1]:http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117931517?categoryid=1236&cs=1&s=h&p=0\n[2]:http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=21641"

    title: "Practical's November Design Revolution!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "For my next redesign, I'm taking this new over-prepared, anal-retentive personality makeover to its logical extreme."
    body: "Yes, I'm calling it the November Design Revision, which should tell you two things:\n\n* I'm taking this new over-prepared, anal-retentive personality makeover to its logical extreme.\n\n* I'm now planning to do redesigns/tweaks about once a month, rather than letting myself get bogged down in a total makeover every 3-6 months. This means more redesigns for me (you know how I love them) and less chaos for you.\n\nOne thing coming back in the November release: comments. I know, I've been back and forth about this, but I've got some ideas for how to make them work visually and I may actually have some visitors who want to comment from time to time, so I'm currently developing some new templates to that end. One thing I'm experimenting with is Ajax-enabled commenting, which should be interesting.\n\nYou may have noticed some lovely, [SimpleBits][1]-esque icons now adorning each post on the home page. They look like SimpleBits because they _are_ SimpleBits: they're an awesome, inexpensive stock icon set called [Chameleon][2] that I've modified to match my evolving color scheme. Yeah, they're stock, but they're perfect.\n\nNow then, onto some new business: as you may be aware, Dear Reader, since last Spring I've been doing business as a web developer under the name The Velocipedist. While that name is a cool name with some cool personal history behind it, I'm finding that it's not a huge hit with clients. Several of them can't pronounce it, and those who can say it kinda hesitantly as if they're afraid they can't pronounce it. In a business world where positive word-of-mouth is a good thing to have, I think I'd prefer that my customers be able to say, \"hey, yeah, you should totally get (name of my company here) to do that website!\" with absolutely no hesitation.\n\nSo I'm retiring the Velocipedist name (to be used on something else later on, possibly) and rebranding my development business to something a little more...familiar, let's put it that way. Haven't decided yet about the bicycle logo -- I love it, but I've got a different logo in mind for the new studio, so we'll see.\n\n[1]:http://simplebits.com/\n[2]:http://chameleon.simplebits.com/"

    title: "Some iPod nano notes"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Griffin announces an innovative iTrip for the Nano, plus some jerk is suing about the scratches."
    body: "<img src=\"http://griffintechnology.com/images/products/prod_itripnano_side02.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 8px 8px; float: right;\" /> [Griffin Technology has announced a new Nano-sized version of the iTrip][1] that, among other cool new features, _uses the Nano's screen for its controls._ The iTrip is one of those FM transmitters that lets you listen to your iPod music over a car stereo, and if you've ever used one you may recall how you had to use a playlist on the iPod to change FM frequencies (containing audible tones that would then get mixed in with your other music while using Shuffle Songs), which made the experience of using an iTrip somewhat horrifying for people who expect their iPods to \"just work\".\n\nApple has so far not offered any way to add software to an iPod or to use the iPod's controls to run another piece of hardware. I'm not sure if this is a hack or a new, more open interface for the iPods -- either way, this may mean we can look forward to a bright new era of stuff you can buy to go with your \$200 music player. You can [learn more about the iTrip for iPod nano][3] on Griffin's site.\n\nSpeaking of the Nano, yes, it's finally happened: [lawyers in California and Ohio have filed a class action lawsuit against Apple over the infamous scratch problem][2]. This is what my mom would have called egregious and decadent, my friends down South would call \"tore up\" and I would call jerk-tastic. And it's not like the Nano is the first-ever iPod to get scratches -- over the past 18 months I've found myself hoping that my iPod would break or be stolen so I'd have an excuse to get a new one that wasn't so scratched up.\n\nAnyway, the suit not only demands a full refund for anyone with a scratchy Nano, but also a share of Apple's profits! To quote [the Signal vs. Noise post on the lawsuit](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/greed_ipodified.php), \"this is a great example of taking a valid claim and turning it into something ridiculous.

    title: "Today I Got Nothin'"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I usually have plenty of story fodder stored up, but today, well..."
    body: "I've been pretty good so far this week with the posting, managing one of my epic-length additions to the site almost every day (if not twice a day), and I _always_ hate to be one of those guys who posts to tell you about an absence of posts, but well, today I got nothin'. I've got plenty of story fodder sitting in the ole' Backpack page I use to track, um, story fodder, but nothing near finished that is both (a) up to my usual standards and (b) not covered by some non-disclosure agreement or \"no blog light.\"\n\nI had briefly toyed with the notion of raiding the archives and posting one of the Apple-related posts that mysteriously disappeared from the site back in June -- and believe me, the day is soon coming when I can tell you _that_ story but today is not that day -- but decided that if I'm not about to publish some unproofed new material I'm sure as hell not about to publish any unproofed _old_ material.\n\nSo here we are, staring off into space. _However_, I can tell you a few things:\n\n* _The Colbert Report_ isn't very good.\n* Both teams playing in the World Series (starting here in Chicago on Saturday) are [Coudal Partners](http://coudal.com/) clients.\n* My next book review will be Zadie Smith's _On Beauty_, and it so far is managing not to charm me quite so much as had _White Teeth_ but is significantly less abhorrent to my senses of storytelling and politics as that other book I was just reading.\n* The new Broken Social Scene record is quite good.\n* Still haven't made it to Hot Doug's, but the weekend is young yet.\n* Apple came out with some new stuff, but since I'm not a professional photographer, sequencing the human genome or wealthy enough to satisfy my PowerBook lust, I'll just have to find some other way of satisfying my need for nerdery.\n* ...like going to [DrunkenBlog](http://drunkenblog.com/)'s Evening at Adler tomorrow night. Because when all you've got is a scissors, everything looks like hair. Or something like that."

    title: "Indecision: a novel by Benjamin Kunkel"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "The novel has exotic locales, sex, drugs and Marxism as weak as yesterday's Sencha, but is undone by the author's ironic inability to make some choices."
    body: "<img alt=\"indecision_cov.jpg\" src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/10/indecision_cov.jpg\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" />This novel (\"available at Amazon.com\":http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1400063450/demareesworld) was recommended to me rather insistently by \"herself the Grand Duchess\":http://stoppayingattention.com/, and I wasn't terribly impressed. True, _Indecision_ has a few elements that are interesting and sometimes fun -- exotic locales, sex, drugs and Marxism as weak as yesterday's Sencha -- but ironically I think it's undone by its author's seeming inability to choose a fucking side. Is this a political screed or a romantic comedy? Is it satirical or serious? I think that it's really none of the above -- this book is all surface, completely facile, and to that extent totally maddening."
    extended: "I'll give you an example by way of one of my least favorite cinematic/literary tropes: the beautiful, fascinating girl who's kinda deep, but only to the extent that they bewitch, bother and bewilder the male protagonist. The Virginia Madsen character in _Sideways_ (Maya, Paul Giamatti's love interest) was such a character -- not to piss off anyone in love with that portrayal, but that character as written is put there simply as an object of interest for the man and never given any interests outside the protagonist's sphere.\n\nThat movie had one such character; Kunkel's novel has _four_. Of course, if you want to compare authors' dick sizes as measured by the number and vacuity of women in their stories, Fellini will always have anyone beat. But Fellini never took himself this seriously, nor was Marcello Mastroianni's inability to choose between Anouk Aimee and Claudia Cardinale presented as a symptom of some mental illness. Kunkel, his protagonist or both are beset by their own abundance of privilege, and I can't get behind that.\n\nDwight, the hero, has a \"dead end job\" most people in the developed world would kill for, working in an office making \$26,000/yr and never having to touch human feces. That he loses this job but can take this as a catalyst to leave one of these beautiful woman-ciphers to chase after another is the sort of problem I only _wish_ I had, and the resulting adventures in exotic Ecuador only fan the flames of insufferableness.\n\nSuch insufferable narratives are already a fixture of recent postmodern literature (see also Eggers, Dave) and not a bad fantasy for sensitive males who wish they were fucking more women than they are or could be doing so with half as much _purpose_. And in that vein the book is totally conventional: I've seen this social commentary a million times, and mixed in are a dysfunctional family drama I've seen a million times alongside a drug narrative I've seen a million times.\n\nSpeaking on the drugs issue, far too much narrative energy is spent talking about various drugs (illegal or otherwise) and their effects (almost exclusively positive) for the book to not have a strong opinion about them. The author seems in favor of drugs but against corporations who make drugs, a viewpoint demonstrated artlessly as one character (incidentally one of these alluring fembots I'm so in arms about) explains for the protagonist how Big Pharma destroys nature, and he's like, oh, okay, I'm sorry that my passive acceptance of American capitalist practice has impeded my own mission to get into your pants.\n\nThere's a lot of acceptance, but no debate, and in that I suspect I just might not be the right audience for this book. It was recommended to Lucy by her dad, and I can imagine him shaking his head at the crazy world these youngsters inhabit. And I can see some kids -- younger, shallower or just more drug-positive than myself -- relating to Dwight and the experience of running off to a resort in South America to get high and get laid and get religion. It's a lovely fantasy, I just don't think it plays well here in the reality-based community.\n\nThis might just be an unreasonably high standard for narrative invention, but a book where the hero's conversion to a new religious or political way of thinking perfectly coincides with a romance, where he consents to accept her God/ethos at nearly the same time as she consents to accept his penis, I feel I can see through as if it were perfectly Windexed glass.\n\nBelief is a trying thing, and it irks me to see the author so immediately, luxuriously reward a guy who's spent 150+ pages demonstrating such largesse as to be rendered indecisive to the point of it becoming a thing, for becoming a poster boy for canned, dogmatic leftist bullshit. I don't doubt that some, including readers of this very website, will disagree that the leftist bullshit portrayed in _Indecision_ is canned, dogmatic or even bullshit. But I hope we can be united in agreement that narratively, this shit ain't shit. Make it all about the girl, or all about the politics, but by emphasizing neither you shortchange both, _dumbass_."

    title: "iTunes 6: What's New, Cool and Not Video"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If you ignore the elephant in the middle of the room -- video -- there's not a lot to talk about with iTunes 6, but there are a few nice little surprises"
    body: "Wow, this has got to be the shortest span of time between major releases since Netscape skipped version 5 entirely. I'm not sure I understand the thinking behind the numbering here, but there's no point in nitpicking -- iTunes is dead, long live iTunes.\n\nIf you ignore the elephant in the middle of the room -- the video iPod and the iTunes Music Store video downloads -- there's not a lot to talk about with iTunes 6 that wasn't in iTunes 5. But there are a few nice little surprises:\n\n* A huge annoyance for me has been that QuickTime movies like the ones included with albums I've bought from the Music Store) have been Shuffled in iTunes, which can be a teeny bit annoying. The same is true for podcasts, audiobooks and other long-form audio files you may not want to see mixed in with your music. So Apple has a solution: a checkbox in the Get Info screen for each song to include (or exclude) a given track from shuffle mode. Music tracks have this turned on by default, while podcasts, audiobooks and videos have it turned off. This is a _great_ idea, and long overdue.\n\n* Audiobooks you purchase and download from the Music Store are bookmarkable so that iPod/iTunes will remember your place if you stop playing, and come back to that spot automatically whenever you resume listening to that audiobook. Unfortunately iTunes has not extended the same courtesy for audiobooks you may have copied onto the computer from CDs. Until now making a track bookmarkable has required changing its file extension _and_ its creator/type codes using a program like ReSourcerer. Now this too is just a checkbox in the Get Info screen.\n\n* The teeny iPod button (which opens iPod Preferences, allowing you to switch into Manual mode or change other iPod settings), which heretofore has been visible only when an iPod is highlighted in the Source list, now is shown as long as there is an iPod plugged in. This should be quite handy for new iPod owners who're trying to change some settings but can't find that damned button. Look for it in the lower right-hand corner of the iTunes window."

    title: "Why Time Estimates Are Hard"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Objectivity ain't easy but it's necessary."
    body: "There's a comment thread over at [Signal vs Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/) about [why people are such bad estimators](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/why_are_people_such_bad_estimators.php):\n\n> Painters say 5 days, it takes 8. Designers say 2 weeks, it takes 4. Programmers say 3 months, it takes 5. Government says it will take \$X and it takes \$XX. Itâ€™s been a very rare occasion (in my life, at least) that estimates have been anywhere near accurate. Even people in business for 20 years seem to have a bad time making accurate estimates. I realize an estimate is just a guess, but thereâ€™s a lot of bad guessing going around. What is it about people that make us such bad estimators?\n\nIt never hurts when analyzing a behavior in people to remember that said people are often driven by  information coming from an unreliable source -- their own memory -- and lack the empathetic thinking skills required for envisioning scenarios involving anything beyond one's self. It's not that a person is incapable of estimating time on something, but rather that objectively evaluating one's own behavior is pretty difficult and required to accurately make such an estimate.\n\nFor example: you know it takes fifteen minutes to get from your house to my house, and maybe will tack on a nominal amount of time (like five minutes) and tell me you'll be over in twenty minutes. But such an estimate may fail to take into account that:\n\n* You have more than five minutes' worth of things to do before you leave, including things you hadn't yet realized you needed to do when you made the estimate.\n\n* What counts in that fifteen minutes? Is that total time from door to door? Is it the door from your apartment, or the door from your building? In the latter case, are you allowing for the time it takes to wait for the elevator? Is it travel time, in which case have you budgeted time to wait for a train or find your car or park?\n\n* Does the trip from your house to mine consistently take 15-20 minutes? Or is it based on just a single trip during which you may have gotten lucky with traffic? Were your previous trips during a peak or off-peak travel time?\n\nOf course I'm not saying we should endeavor to make perfect estimates to our friends, and I certainly can't say I even notice if someone says they'll be over in 15 minutes and they show up in 25 or 30. My point was to illustrate how a person's memory and self-perception can affect their ability to objectively estimate time, and that's why work estimates are often wrong."

    title: "Post Titles, or: My Opacity Problem"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "You mean \"Un jour sans soleil\" doesn't tell people it's a post about the fifth-generation iPods? Tschaa!"
    body: "Web information design guru [Jakob Neilsen](http://useit.com/), who I used to read religiously but sort of fell out of touch with, has just posted his list of [Top 10 design mistakes on weblog sites](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html), and I'd say I'm actively guilty of at least four of them, but the one to stick out is Number 3:\n\n> **Nondescript posting titles**   \nSadly, even though weblogs are native to the Web, authors rarely follow the guidelines for writing for the Web in terms of making content scannable...[and] it's even more important with headlines. Users must be able to grasp the gist of an article by reading its headline. Avoid cute or humorous headlines that make no sense out of context...Descriptive headlines are especially important for representing your weblog in search engines, newsfeeds (RSS), and other external environments. In fact, people often read only the first three or four words of a headline when scanning a list of possible places to go.\n\nWhat, you mean \"Un jour sans soleil\" doesn't tell people it's a post about how the fifth-generation iPods lack the option for a FireWire cable connection? Tschaa!\n\nYou may have already noticed that some post titles have changed this morning, and that's because I can _totally_ get into what Neilsen is saying here and wanted to change my ways starting, um, last month. Because it's true, I am extremely guilty of the cutesy title problem, and more importantly it really annoys me when I see cutesy, uninformative titles on the sites I read.\n\nI'm subscribed to a couple hundred RSS feeds, and so I know: it's not just about scanning the pages. It's about scanning _that damned list of headlines_. The problem with my (and most) cutesy titles is their opacity. They're like a blank wall: they give absolutely no indication of what's to be found behind them, on the page they link to. These can be evocative and reflective of the _theme_ of a piece, but often as not they're just esoteric or dumb. (In the category of Mac blogs, [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) is a great example of the former while [DrunkenBlog](http://drunkenblog.com/) is an unfortunate example of the latter.)\n\nMy headline writing style on Practicalmadness (which was inherited from the site's predecessor e-mail newsletter, the _Communique_) are interesting phrases and evocative of my personality, but the interestingness and evocation are seldom necessarily related to the content of the piece. That's because until today, I have never thought to take them seriously as an aspect of the posts I'm writing, rather than as little signifiers of myself. I could allow myself some poetry in the titling if I was at least sticking to themes, but most of the headlines on this site are not indicative of poetic license. They're rather more indicative of a writer with a lazy process and an unwillingness to actually read himself (or write past the first draft, apparently).\n\nThe big wake-up call for me, was realizing that if I subscribed to the site's RSS feed these titles would drive me _nuts_, just as the post titles on DrunkenBlog drive me nuts. When I've got 200+ new headlines to either read, delete or mark for later reading _right dammit now_ before the next batch of 200 comes in, I need to be able to evaluate a page for content in a split second. Opaquely written headlines reek of added noise in my growing list of feeds, and I _abhor_ noise.\n\nAnother reason is my current Fall Traffic Initiative -- I have set a goal of doubling my daily pageviews and increasing browsing within the site (as measured by the ratio of hits to unique visitors, indicating that individual readers are going to multiple pages on the same visit) by a decent percentage. So far the improved (i.e., extant) navigation has helped, but being able to easily navigate over 400 esoterically named pieces of content doesn't sound like an improvement. It's easier, but it's no more logical.\n\nI don't post consistently enough for readers (potential or otherwise) to have a strong sense of what I'm about, and while I've worked on improving the design and the writing to attract new readers it has never occurred to me to improve _the headlines_. If I were a potential new reader, I would have to overcome the strong, strong temptation to scroll past something called \"Un jour sans soleil\" coming from some guy's blog.\n\nI _might_ however click on a piece titled \"Video iPod Lacks FireWire, And I Cry.\" Because hey! I'm crying about that too!"

    body: "The company I work for, design firm \"The Killswitch Collective\":http://www.killswitchcollective.com/, just launched a brand-new website chock full of Demaree goodness. Credit for the design belongs to Ben Finch & Meredith Martin; mine was the task of taking their ambitious plan for the site and turning it into flexible, searchable DHTML+CSS. I don't think it validates -- I settled for \"displays agreeably on both Mozilla and IE\" -- but keep your eyes peeled for the copious amounts of Ajaxed JavaScript, live text-to-image translation and rocking of the \"Prototype\":http://prototype.conio.net/ library that made The Most Ambitious Site I've Ever Attempted a joy to build. I must leave some mad props not only -- and once again -- for Prototype developer \"Sam Stephenson\":http://conio.net/, but also for the contributors to the \"script.aculo.us Wiki\":http://wiki.script.aculo.us/ who've provided the beginnings of some solid documentation. (Oh, and we got \"Gapers Blocked\":http://www.gapersblock.com/news/archives/2005/10/#010636 too.)\n\nSince I'm on the subject of Web firms based in Chicago's Near West Side, I should link to \"this short Chicago Sun-Times piece about 37signals\":http://www.suntimes.com/output/business/cst-fin-signal17.html, the company those of us in the know have all loved to hate on since 2002.\n\nAnd since I can't not: \"OMFG SOX WIN SOX WIN!!!\":http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20051016&content_id=1252002&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Which means several things:\n\n* The World Series is coming to the Windy City, which I'm sure will be seen as breaking some sort of curse.\n\n* Either the Sox will win, which will continue to be seen as breaking some sort of curse, or they will lose, reinforcing the idea that there is some sort of a curse.\n\n* In either case, Cubs fans will temporarily forget their ongoing failure to remember that, yes, there is _a whole half of the city south of Roosevelt Street_, that it even has its own Major League Baseball team, and just be joyful that they can get happy drunk, as opposed to the angry, bitter drunk that comes from watching the Bears suck at football or the clueless, neutral drunk from watching the Cubs suck at baseball.\n\n* At no time during any of this will the Cubs fans realize that their willingness to hand over money in support of their team no matter how badly they suck might in fact be a contributing factor to the ongoing suckness of the Cubs.\n\n* We will need t-shirts emblazoned with the following slogan: *I SURVIVED THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX WORLD SERIES RIOT OF 2005 AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.*\n\n<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/10/pic_whitesox.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"344\" width=\"264\" alt=\"pic_whitesox.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> \"This week's podcast from Sen.

    body: "So in the space of an hour Steve Jobs gave us three things we've always dreamed of:\n\n* A video iPod\n* A _black_ iPod\n* A reliable way to legally download episodes of _Lost_.\n\nI'll confess: I'm smitten with the new 60 GB iPod, because it's thinner than my current 30 GB Photo, holds twice the data and, well, does video. But there's one little problem: the new video-capable iPods do not support FireWire. The only option for moving these thousands of songs or hundreds of hours of video onto these new little marvels is USB 2.0.\n\nEvery hard-disk-based iPod so far, including the Mini, has been able to connect via either USB or FireWire.  I can accept the loss of FireWire on those players as a necessary compromise to hit the size and price targets Apple wanted to hit, and my home computer comes equipped with USB 2.0 so this wouldn't be a problem if I only ever needed to hook into my iPod at home.\n\nNo, the problem is that I use my iPod as a portable hard drive as well as a music player, and the Power Mac at my office is an older model that has USB, but not USB 2.0, so it will work but very, very slowly. And I work with some _big_ files sometimes, so my dreams of upgrading to a 60-gig black iPod got a swift kick in the reality check when I realized that all that storage would be pretty much useless at work."

However, a certain number of you may have turned your brains off at mention of a technical-sounding term like \"multi-platform chat client,\" and just want to be able to talk to your MSN friends using Yahoo's software (or vice versa), and now you'll be able to do just that.\n\nThis gets us a step closer to the holy grail: a single screen name usable for all the services, so that you can change your e-mail signatures, business cards and other sources of contact info to just say \"IM: yourscreennamehere\" instead of a long, confusing combination of services, logins and e-mails. And as I say this I am aware of the fact that five years ago having more than one _phone number_ was pretty hot in itself, so with this kind of technological progress surely we'll be back into space exploration before too long.\n\nMoon pies: what a time to be alive."

    title: "Apple's \"One More Thing\" Event"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I have little doubt that there will be some kind of hard disk-based iPod announced today."
    body: "In a few short hours Apple will be thrilling(!) us all with their latest whatever, expected by \"certain websites\":http://thinksecret.com/news/0510oct12d.html to be (at the very least) a fifth-generation iPod. I have little doubt that there will be _some_ kind of hard disk-based iPod announced today: the Click Wheel iPods dropped in July 2004, and while yes, they _have_ added color screens since then the current models are not _that_ different. They're just now due for a redesign, and the success of the iPod nano indicates that they might finally be open to releasing the flagship iPod in colors other than the company's, um, signature color. (Which is, uh, \"snow.\")\n\nOf course, I've so far managed to totally avoid the elephant in the middle of the room: the long-rumored, much-hyped video iPod is supposed to be announced today. Sure, it wouldn't surprise me if one of the many improvements in the fifth-gen iPod is the ability to play video clips, but there are reasons not to get too worked up about that right now. I'll expand on that later this morning as part of a larger workup on what Apple might do, _should_ do and (after the show) have done, but just to summarize what I expect to see today:\n\n* *The fifth-generation flagship iPod.* This will be a hard disk-based iPod with a new enclosure (but not too new -- I expect the Click Wheel to stick around), new capacities and some new features. And yes, one of those features might be video playback. I expect the pricing to remain the same (\$299 and up) and I'll go out on a limb and predict that we'll finally see a black iPod _without_ Bono's signature on it.\n\n* *Some kind of iTunes Music Store (iTMS) revision* and I'm not just saying that because iTMS skipped its regular Tuesday update yesterday. The iTMS has always been revised in some major way every six months, in April and October, so we'll see anything from something small (like iMixes) to paid video downloads (to be watched on your video iPod, of course).\n\n* *New Macs?* Maybe. The only Apple computers that _aren't_ due for an upgrade are the iBooks, which were refreshed less than 90 days ago. I won't care to speculate which Apple machines will get the whammy today, but it's been 5-6 months since the last major Power Mac and iMac revisions, and it the holiday shopping season _is_ coming up. If any new CPUs are announced today, they'll be more along the lines of speed bumps and minor improvements -- anything more might upstage the new iPod, and we simply can't have _that,_ can we?\n\n*Update:* \"iLounge has pictures of an iPod ad with a wider, bigger screen.\":http://ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/ilounge-exclusive-new-ipod-revealed/ (Via \"Daring Fireball\":http://daringfireball.net/)"

    title: "Why Do Online Shops Require Registration?"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "As part of a larger philosophical debate over logins, e-commerce and account-less web services, I've been pondering Evite."
    body: "To everything there is a season, my friends. A rolling stone gathers no moss! A bird in hand is worth two in the, um...bush? Okay, so I'm not great with proverbs, but I am great at making vague pronouncements of things I'll be doing on the web. And lately, as part of a larger philosophical debate over logins, e-commerce and account-less web services -- as well as figuring out when and how and where to finally have my fabled horsewarming party for the new apartment -- I've been pondering \"Evite.\":http://evite.com/"
    extended: "I don't know a single person who's enthusiastic about using Evite, which is not to say I don't know anyone who uses it. A lot of people use it, but nobody _loves_ it. Why is that? The first tiny detail that springs to mind is that *you have to register to send invites,* and it's not always clear how much of yourself you have to leave behind just to use the service, or what added benefit there is to registering when you can just send out an e-mail or post to a blog. \n\nWhen you register for and sign into a website in order to use it, is that a feature or just a way of forcing you to provide useful marketing data? Sure, registration makes sense when the site is storing some valuable data, like your online banking info or your pictures, but just to send a quick invite?\n\nI'm lately a big proponent of sites where registration is not required. An account-less web service (in my view) can and should still offer some optional \"power-user\" features for people who want to register and sign in, but the most basic stuff should be a little more open.\n\nMy model for this is \"Threadless\":http://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=ddemaree, the online t-shirt store that offers some useful features (like an order history and a referral reward program) if you care to sign in, but doesn't need you to set up a password just to pick out a cool shirt. For that you just need to have a valid shipping address, e-mail address and credit card number.\n\nA colleague characterized account-less e-commerce sites as \"not caring who you are as long as the check clears,\" implying that user accounts create a more intimate connection between shopper and shopkeeper. To which I say: _it's on the internets._ We're not at all talking about intimacy, we're talking about degrees of alienation. To break it down to the real world: if you're having a garage sale, you don't need to know who is buying your vintage Snoopy lunchbox, only that they've got cash. Of course, you may get into an awesome conversation with the buyer of your Snoopy lunchbox and ask who they are and find out about them and fall in love with them and have ten thousand of their babies, but that's a separate thing not directly related to the commercial exchange of money for a Snoopy lunchbox.\n\nI hopped onto this train of thought when I started thinking on picking a service or making a web page to announce my now-delayed housewarming party. Evite looks all right, but their process is cumbersome and I don't love their designs. There are invite sites that do what I want to do, but they don't look great. And I could just do all this myself, using my skills as an information design ninja, but that's just more work for me next time I have a party. Besides, if I put in the work to do this for my own party, what if I could offer a similarly awesome online invite to my friends next time _they_ have a party?\n\nThus the train of thought has led me here: I will be developing an online invite app this Fall. It will be called C'Mere. It will be easy to use and will look great, and if I can accomplish even half of what I want to do with this thing I think it could be big. Like Danny Kaye big.\n\nI've got an e-mail list going for more information about C'Mere (what it is, when it's launching, etc.) on, well, \"the C'Mere site\":http://cmere.net/."

    body: "Malcolm Gladwell, author of [_Blink_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316172324/demareesworld) and [_The Tipping Point_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316346624/demareesworld), has a good piece in the current New Yorker covering <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/printables/critics/051010crat_atlarge\">the history and sociology of Ivy League admissions</a>, tracing the evolution of the admissions process from a short-lived meritocracy at Harvard where students were accepted based solely on superior test scores, to something more like this:\n\n> By the nineteen-sixties, Harvard&rsquo;s admissions system had evolved into a series of complex algorithms. The school began by lumping all applicants into one of twenty-two dockets, according to their geographical origin. (There was one docket for Exeter and Andover, another for the eight Rocky Mountain states.) Information from interviews, references, and student essays was then used to grade each applicant on a scale of 1 to 6, along four dimensions: personal, academic, extracurricular, and athletic. Competition, critically, was within each docket, not between dockets, so there was no way for, say, the graduates of Bronx Science and Stuyvesant to shut out the graduates of Andover and Exeter. More important, academic achievement was just one of four dimensions, further diluting the value of pure intellectual accomplishment. Athletic ability, rather than falling under &ldquo;extracurriculars,&rdquo; got a category all to itself, which explains why, even now, recruited athletes have an acceptance rate to the Ivies at well over twice the rate of other students, despite S.A.T. scores that are on average more than a hundred points lower. And the most important category? That mysterious index of &ldquo;personal&rdquo; qualities.\n\nAnd how did the process evolve from using a standardized test to considering two &eacute;lite New England prep schools to be as significant a geographic entity as the entire Western United States? Three words: fear of Jews.\n\nAlso in the New Yorker: Nick Paumgarten has an article studying 'the Matthew effect' (the theoretical means by which celebrities get more credit than non-celebrities for doing the same work) as it pertains to <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/051010ta_talk_paumgarten\">Columbia professors and their doormen.</a> Both good reads; check 'em out."

    title: "Troubles with Citibank"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Seriously, I was only trying to give these people money. What is so hard about that?"
    body: "I was only trying to _give these people money,_ for once again I'm having to change my address and make a late payment on the overdraft credit line on the Citibank checking account I closed 28 months ago. The bills for this account have been going to my recently late mother's address in Alabama, so no I don't have my account number handy.\n\nLast week they left a message on my voicemail asking that I call them immediately, so I call them and I press zero to get an operator, and I'm put on hold and I get the standard \"all of our representatives are currently assisting other customers\" message. Then something unexpected happens: after about 60 seconds on hold, the recording says \"all of our representatives are currently assisting other customers, _or_ you have tried to reach us outside our normal business hours. Please try again later.\"\n\n_Click._ Citibank's phone system got tired of being on hold and hung up on me.\n\nI am only trying to _give these people money_, and they cannot be bothered to take my phone call. I don't care about waiting on hold for forty minutes, I don't care whether the person I have to talk to is in this country or in India -- just give me a person who will accept my late payment.\n\nI decide this morning to go about things differently. On my computer I still have the collections department phone number from the _last_ time I was past due on this credit line, and as I'm walking to the Blue Line from my house I make the call. It takes about twenty minutes to walk to Damen Avenue from home, and for every single minute of that walk I was waiting to talk to Citibank. When a live person finally picks up I explain the following needs, in the following order:\n\n* To pay a two-month, past due bill on a Citibank credit line\n* And to change my address\n\nI am asked for my personal information, I provide it and the lady is able to see my account on her computer. However, I am not able to provide my account number or my Citibank ATM card number. I am thus transferred to the regular telephone banking hotline. Why? Because I have to verify my account number to be permitted to change my address.\n\nI'll take this opportunity to point out that I am not opposed to outsourced foreign call centers because of some  America-first, xenophobic bullshit. I'm opposed to them because it's simply not in their mandate to provide quality service. These phone agents have a very, very short list of things they can do for you or tell you, and Citibank is particularly odious in giving their call center agents (foreign _or_ domestic) absolutely no power to resolve your problems.\n\nThe reason these Indian companies have been so successful at landing these support contracts is that they speak the Queen's English, they take orders well and they're unfailingly polite. In fact, they're _too_ polite: the woman I spoke to this morning simply stopped speaking rather than finish a sentence that may have contained important information, all because she wasn't sure I was done talking.\n\nIt is finally explained to me that because I don't have my account number or Citicard number, they can't change my address over the phone. So I ask to just make the payment. Two minutes later I'm speaking to an American in the very same Citibank office that called me on Thursday; four minutes after that it's all done.\n\nThis has been more or less consistent with my overall experience with Citibank. It's not just that they're making things hard on us customers in order to save a buck. Their phone trees and policies are so byzantine, their commitment to unhelpfulness so absolute, that I can't help but wonder if doing business this way _costs_ them money, and perhaps has more to do with lost brain cells than lost dollars.\n\nI expect (and get) this sort of crap from utility companies that have no competition, stiff regulation and a pretty much impossible mandate to serve the people _and_ make money. It's baffling that you'd get better service from Peoples Gas than Citibank, especially when there are nine other banks (three of them major players) to compete with here in Chicago.\n\nCould someone give me even one reason why you would _want_ to be in business with Citibank, as opposed to Bank of America/Fleet or Chase/Bank One? I mean, seriously: _I was only trying to give these people money._ What is so hard about that?"

    body: "<a href=\"http://rollyo.com/\">ROLLYO</a> is a new website that lets you create your own Yahoo-powered search engines, or \"searchrolls,' from a list of 25 sites that you like. For example, I just created a searchroll covering my favorite sites for web design and nerdery, and later I may create one for general crazy stuff.\n\nRollyo's got some problems to solve before they can achieve the people's ovation and fame forever:\n\n* Their \"Tools\" page lists tools that don't yet exist. There's nothing more annoying than seeing a link to a page where you're supposed to be able to download a Rollyo desktop widget and getting a \"Coming Soon!\" message. Me, I'd have put a list of upcoming cool features at the bottom of that Tools page under the header \"Coming Soon\". Then people would come back to the site to see if they're available yet.\n\n* One of the Tools that's \"Coming Soon\" is the ability to place Rollyo searchrolls on your own site. This is critical, because right now you can only search your own stuff, which isn't consistent with how people use search. Granted, I do sometimes use the `site:` keyword in Google to limit my results to a single website, but that's when I'm looking for something specific that I once saw on that website, and that's using the same search engine I use for everything else. So the appeal of something like Rollyo is to give people the ability to find what they want to see, but filtered through _your_ favorite websites. You get to invite them into your online sphere, and the obvious way to do that is to put a Rollyo box on your blog. (Well, or to set up some kind of Rollyo friends list or shared searchroll feature, which doesn't appear to be in the offing. And seeing as how Rollyo has no problem linking to features they don't have yet, this one might take a while. So yeah, your blog. It needs Rollyo.)\n\n* This page looks like [ODEO](http://odeo.com/) with a different paint job. This would trouble me more if (a) I didn't prefer this style of layout in Rollyo Red way more than ODEO Pink, and (b) anyone were using ODEO for anything. (Amazing how getting beaten to market by iTunes's podcasting feature can kill the buzz for a podcasting startup.) But I do appreciate some originality in web design, and this mimics too many trends to earn my respect.\n\n* I guess what I'm getting at above is that Rollyo wears its Web 2.0-ness on its sleeve, and that style of website is both visually and functionally wearing out its welcome with me. The design trends I'm starting to tire of include dark gray text on black, large areas of bright, bright color, bold Arial/Helvetica with the letter-spacing turned to -1px <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,Arial;font-weight:bold;letter-spacing:-1px\">like this</span>, and yes, even AJAX. Later this morning I will be doing something unprecedented: removing an AJAX feature from a site I had previously AJAXed, because it was just extraneous. The AJAX on Rollyo doesn't do anything new or interesting (so far). Put up or get rid of it."

    body: "As _Political Friday!_ continues on the blog, apparently being a conservative doesn't put you on the right wing of an aisle so much as a split hair. [Josh Marshall](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/) posted [a letter from New Mexico congresswoman Heather Wilson regarding her support for Bush's Gulf Coast Wage Cut](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_09_18.php#006612) (emphasis hers):\n\n> The Davis-Bacon Act, which dates back to 1931, requires every construction contract in excess of two thousand dollars to which the federal government is a party to pay all laborers and mechanics not less than the locally prevailing wage. Under Section 6 of the Act, the President may suspend the requirements of the Act during a \"national emergency.\" Over its long history, the Act has been suspended several times for various types of national emergencies including war, economic emergency, and natural disaster. Suspension of the Act permits, **but does not require**, that less than the prevailing wage be paid on the covered contracts.\n\n> ...\n\n> The Davis-Bacon act can add weeks to federally financed construction projects and it increases costs to the taxpayers - also producing delays in construction since the available funds will be limited. President George H. W. Bush temporarily suspended the Davis-Bacon Act during the recovery from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 to help rebuild that area of Florida in an expeditious and affordable fashion.\n\nI think this is a really great explanation of the function of the Davis-Bacon Act and the purpose that suspending it is _supposed_ to serve, and (if you've taken the Kool-Aid, like Wilson seems to have) I'm sure loyal conservatives honestly believe that suspending the Act is simply removing a layer of bureaucracy that would unduly slow down the reconstruction process and waste federal money.\n\nAs I explained yesterday, saving federal money isn't a relevant goal as the President has already promised to spend whatever is necessary to rebuild the Gulf Coast. \$200 billion is an _estimated minimum_ to put it generously. _Numbers the White House pulled out of its collective ass_ is more accurate.\n\nIt's great to save money if that's the intention, and an argument can be made that you should suspend Davis-Bacon because it gives reconstruction planners more flexibility in staffing -- e.g., you can get some less experienced or less skilled laborers to mix the concrete or something rather than hire someone who does it professionally -- and you can get more people for the same money. This argument is predicated on two assumptions:\n\n* That the reconstruction companies are competent.\n* And that they plan to hire more workers for the same money, not the same workers for less money and pocket the rest.\n\nThose apply to Halliburton, right?"

    body: "Another gem from one of our nation's great ironists, White House spokesman Scott McLellan. Upon being asked about the President's decision to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act (which guarantees that workers employed by government-run construction projects must be paid the \"prevailing wage\" for such work in that particular area):\n\n> **Q:** Scott, Representative LoBiondo from New Jersey, Republican, is circulating a letter calling on the President to rescind the tax cut, which he signed into effect for the people who are going to be rebuilding the Gulf Coast. In light of that, and in light of the need that people have to be working and to be earning decent money down there, is the President reconsidering this wage cut?\n\n> **McLellan:** We suspended that act for the reasons that we stated previously. This will open up access to more business -- small businesses, including women-owned and minority-owned businesses. It cuts through the red tape and helps us move forward quickly to address the needs of the people in the region and to provide substantial savings. We're talking about savings here in terms of spending. That's an important part of that, too.\n\n> **Q:** But how does lowering people's wages help with rebuilding the economy?\n\n> **McLellan:** Well, I disagree with your characterization, first of all...We actually talked about this last week. You might want to look back. Claude Allen briefed on this and talked about our position on this and why this was another important area to cut through some of the red tape that prevents us from moving forward as quickly as possible. And it opens it up to more people, so that women-owned and minority-owned businesses can participate more fully in that, as well.\n\n> And we want, the President made it clear, that in terms of jobs and contracts and things of that nature, he believes they should go mostly to those who have been affected by this hurricane. And that's something we're committed to doing. So this was an important -- we've issued a number of waivers to cut through red tape and bureaucracy, and this was one of those.\n\n> **Q:** Is the President aware that there is a move on Capitol Hill to call on him to rescind this?\n\n> **McLellan:** We're aware that there are people that are opposed to that on the other side of the fence.\n\nSo to break this down for those of us who may not have the skill to understand McLellan's particular brand of poetry, what he's saying is: we suspended the act to give more businesses access to the ability to pay their workers the minimum wage for skilled labor, and you never know, that may give women- and minority-owned businesses an extra boost because everybody knows they couldn't compete if they actually had to pay people to work for them. And while this will cut through red tape in a way that I'm sure is as obvious to you as it is to me, the most important outcome of the suspension is that it will save money.\n\nAnd whose money will it save? The taxpayers? We're already committed to spending \$200 billion on Katrina (and likely Rita) relief and reconstruction, and Republican members of Congress are already working on cutting any federal programs they can in order to staunch the flow of red ink, considering that the two most obvious sources of cash -- Bush's tax cut and the war in Iraq -- are off limits. The government doesn't care about saving money because they're essentially floating a check to pay for this thing.\n\nSo the only people for whom the Davis-Bacon suspension will save money are business owners. Now, Bush and co. like to have it two ways when they talk about \"business owners\". Taking full advantage of Dubya's supposed folksy charm, when he or his Administration _says_ it it's supposed to evoke an image of a family-owned restaurant or your brother's dry cleaning shop or a small-town law office (e.g. Atticus Finch). Those are all small businesses, and they all have a certain flavor of Americana that makes people turn into quivering balls of nostalgia.\n\nOf course, what they _mean_ when they say that, who they're really talking about, are corporations like Halliburton and Carlyle with ties to the Bush family or other Administration figures. And even if it's not such brazen cronyism, it's still intended to benefit big business by reversing the flow of government regulation. Under laws like Davis-Bacon, the government is protecting the workers by setting up rules governing how businesses must compensate them.\n\nBy suspending Davis-Bacon and establishing a vast federal bureaucracy to manage the reconstruction of the Gulf Coast, the Administration is eliminating competition and effectively giving its blessing to paying all laborers the same poverty-level wage. They could draft the entire population of New Orleans into the Army and they'd be better off than they will be trying to get into any of this \"Gulf Opportunity Zone\" crap."

    body: "On last Friday's season finale of my beloved [_Battlestar Galactica_](http://scifi.com/battlestar/), our intrepid whatevers (who believe they are the sole survivors of the Colonial Fleet following the Cylon sneak attack back in the 2003 miniseries/pilot) encountered another Colonial ship, the _Pegasus_, whose crew is in a far more military frame of mind than the _Galactica_ crew. They keep score of their enemy kills, they hold warp drive-speed military tribunals then summarily execute the defendants and -- we learn -- have been raping and brutally torturing a female Cylon prisoner for months. (That's she's a clone of Number Six, the Cylon supermodel that _Galactica_'s sleazy Dr. Baltar has been seeing in his head since the series began, is either easier or harder on the viewers, depending on how you feel about the Six-Baltar relationship.)\n\nThe big theme of the show is that the enemy is us -- the sci-fi clich&eacute; is to have a relentless, inhuman enemy bent on annihilation, but _BSG_ is more interested in defying the formula by making both sides relatable and (at times) hateable. They're not about a _Star Trek_-like exploration of what humanity _can be_, but a darker, grittier look at what we _are_. _Star Trek_ is about some modernist ideal of pushing the boundaries of knowledge for the greater glory of mankind; _Galactica_ is about what happens _after_ that, the quest to merely survive after pushing one of those boundaries goes horribly wrong.\n\nIn that sense you could make the argument that _Galactica_ isn't sci-fi at all -- it's a drama series that happens to be set in space.\n\nBut I'm dancing around the issue: how do I feel about rape and torture on _Galactica_? Of course, they pulled a punch here: the show is able to maintain a distance from atrocity because it happened on another ship, and it would have been more disturbing -- and more in line with what we've seen on the news about our own military -- had it been our own on-screen \"friends\" on the _Galactica_ doing the rape. (It also would have been out of character, and really, who would watch these guys knowing that they had done that?)\n\nOne big difference is that only one of the ships is fully at war: _Galactica_ has been defending the remnants of the civilian society from the Cylon threat, whereas _Pegasus_ has simply been fighting the Cylons. Unlike _Galactica_ which travels with a civilian fleet and answers to a civilian government, _Pegasus_ has no body politic, no authority besides its own commander and no greater purpose than target destruction. They've been flying under the assumption that they're alone in the universe and at war with an enemy that can appear with no warning and strike without remorse, and so they must be prepared to fight a different kind of war.\n\nSound familiar? Again: We have seen the enemy and he is us. The season ends with the two ships launching fighters against each other, _Pegasus_ due to execute two _Galactica_ crewmen for killing the officer who was about to rape _Galactica's_ own Cylon prisoner, and our own Dr. Baltar promising to help the Cylon victim on Pegasus. It's like the wise, noble, tragically fictional administration on _The West Wing_ marching on the Bush White House with torches.\n\nI can't wait for the show to come back in January."

    title: "Microsoft Changes Their Ways (Somewhat)"

    body: "There's an [article in the Wall Street Journal about the making of Windows Vista](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112743680328349448,00.html), and though it pains me to say it, it almost makes me feel excited for the damned thing to come out. I spent my whole day today repairing my girlfriend's Windows XP installation, and things like this make me hopeful for a World Without Spyware:\n\n> By late October, Mr. Srivastava's team was beginning to automate the testing that had historically been done by hand. If a feature had too many bugs, software \"gates\" rejected it from being used in Longhorn. If engineers had too many outstanding bugs they were tossed in \"bug jail\" and banned from writing new code. The goal, he says, was to get engineers to \"do it right the first time.\"\n\nMany/most software companies do automated tests, like unit or functional tests, for a simple reason: unless you're Microsoft, you can't afford to pay top engineers to develop cool features _and_ fix bugs _and_ get everything out on time. So smaller teams have spent years finding development processes that help them make the most of limited time and manpower.\n\nI had always assumed that the reason Microsoft couldn't adapt to things like the spyware epidemic was that its development efforts were _too_ bureaucratic, _too_ restrictive, when in fact the problem was a _laizzez faire_ culture that respected an individual programmer's creativity at the expense of being able to have _any_ control over the code base for their company's flagship product.\n\nHaving spent the day in a Windows XP mindset was refreshing, because while I find my Mac a _lot_ more intuitive if you're a highly visual person, I can totally see while people with different ways of working things out logically could dig Windows. Windows is aggressively verbal (whereas Mac OS X is aggressively visual), and makes things easier by giving you a set of logical choices (expressed as text links) for a given context. In other words, you have a picture in your pictures folder, to which you can do one or more picture things.\n\nThere are some very disappointing things about the pre-release Windows Vista -- first on the list for me are the still-lackluster support for CSS Levels 2 and 3 in IE7, as well as the general bending-over-to-big-media DRM restrictions -- but that Great White can learn to adopt more creative, agile practices makes me curious (and as a Mac user, a little afraid) for the _next_ version of Windows"

    body: "On [Taegan Goddard's Political Wire](http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoliticalWire?m=1309) this morning:\n\n> Nick Gillespie reviews a new study by the American Enterprise Institute that calculates President Bush \"has boosted total inflation-adjusted discretionary spending in his first term by 35.1 percent. To put that in context, chew on this: LBJ -- the Texas legend who created the Great Society and, for all intents and purposes, the Vietnam War -- only boosted discretionary spending 33.4 percent. What's more, the gap between Bush and LBJ will only grow.... since the final outlays for fiscal year 2005 (the last budget signed in Bush's first term) aren't in yet.\"\n\n> The great irony is that the conservative political movement was spawned in response to Lyndon Johnson's domestic policies. Now, it's leader, George W. Bush, may cause it's undoing. It's no wonder so many conservatives are turning on the president."

    body: "There's a funny thing about the labels 'liberal' and 'conservative:' they have to do with how the government spends money. And there's a whole set of ideological baggage that comes with those labels -- the money spent as a reflection of government's role in people's lives, the division between federal and state government -- but ultimately it comes down to the money. If you'll allow me the gross generalization, any other use of the terms 'liberal' or 'conservative' (or their pejorative siblings 'left' and 'right,' or 'red' and 'blue') to describe a politician or platform in America is at the very least an over-simplification.\n\nImagine how much harder it would be to demonize (or even understand) those on the left on social issues if we had to call them secular humanists. What would you think of right-wing Christian conservatives if we called them radical theocrats? A more precise description of ideology doesn't give you nearly as many enemies. A tiny-headed blue stater can think about all those dumb redneck motherfuckers in the red states are fascists for opposing gay marriage, while a similarly clueless red stater can get hot and bothered about how those blue state liberals are poisoning this country's morals.\n\nI was thinking about this last night as I looked over the bullet points of our red-state, right-wing _conservative_ President's address to the nation where he announced his post-Katrina reconstruction program, a plan that any conservative would call a suicidally stupid expansion of big-government spending if the guy proposing it weren't on their own team."
    extended: "\n\nMaybe New Orleans should be rebuilt, maybe it shouldn't -- that is not for me to tell you, as I'm not an urban planner, a meteorologist, an engineer or a politician. But Katrina hit the Gulf Coast three weeks ago, the damage to buildings and infrastructure in New Orleans hasn't even been adequately assessed yet and here we are promising to spend whatever it costs to rebuild it? Tell me, does the federal government _enjoy_ writing blank checks with my tax dollars?\n\nConservatives -- as is their brief -- make hay over excessive government spending and believe (perhaps dogmatically) that the free market system can be a far more efficient vehicle for social change than anything government can do, not least because government is of and by the people but is not necessarily _owned by_ the people.\n\nWhen you believe in free enterprise the way the other side does you don't so much believe in giving in accepting charity. Instead you feel that the work to create a great nation must be shared by all of its citizens, and those who help to create wealth (for themselves, for others -- whatever, the point is that you're creating wealth) become spiritually, emotionally and (in theory) practically wealthier in the process. For example, the more doctrinaire Republicans want to dismantle Social Security for this reason: you may be entitled to Social Security, and you're legally required to invest in it, but you don't own it and you have no say in how your investment is returned to you.\n\nConservative dogma is founded on an inherent distrust of government, and therefore a strong ideological imperative to keep it small and keep tax dollars in the hands of the people. Regardless of how this ideology works out in practice, that's what they believe in.\n\nYou could make the argument that President Bush believes, therefore, in conservatism: much of the on-the-ground work of reconstructing the Gulf Coast will be done by private companies under contract to the federal government, and private companies can do it better, right? There's competition, so they'd better do a good job or we'll fire them and hire someone else. They're not the government, so if they do a really bad job we can sue them without enacting some creaky 200-year-old system of checks and balances. Corporations can offer stock and therefore be owned by the people, and therefore be held accountable to the people-cum-shareholders, and that's great because when people own a piece of the agencies that will be doing the dirty work of managing our society they'll be more invested (in the non-monetary sense) and will -- here's the kicker -- work harder to create more wealth!\n\nIt would seem that the \"Marshall Plan for the Gulf\" is founded upon such an asurdly na&iuml;ve understanding of government and private enterprise, except for a few small details:\n\nThere is no competition because the contracts being awarded to firms managing the reconstruction are no-bid contracts. No competition means that the companies don't have to worry about the quality of their work, and therefore no accountability.\n\nSince there's no accountability there's no imperative to keep costs low. There is, however, a _legal mandate_ in the charter of any for-profit corporation to maximize shareholder value by increasing revenues and profits. Therefore, in the absence of a contractual imperative to keep the costs low, these deals fall under the more general imperative to make money and so the costs will be quite high.\n\nAnd the money paying for this contract work isn't exactly taxpayer dollars -- it actually doesn't exist. In free enterprise a corporation is accountable to the people putting up the cash, but while this money is being spent by the sitting government, who were elected by the people, it doesn't belong to either. It belongs to the same person that any debt belongs to: they who's gotta pay it off.\n\nAnd that isn't the body politic (at least not the body politic that voted for this Administration) and it sure ain't the sitting government. It's you and I and our children and possibly their children. My mother always tried to impress upon me that it was stupid to pay for something on credit if you've got the cash, and suicidal to do so if you don't have the cash.\n\nUnder the program announced last night, we are purchasing \$200 billion in recovery services from companies who have no clear contractual or legal imperative to work quickly, efficiently or well for so long as they are providing the agreed-upon service, who have no fear of getting fired or losing the bid to a competing firm, and putting on a credit card. Except that the credit card is everyone's retirement funds (and their kids' retirement funds). As for the interest rate, well...that'll be the next hurricane. Because I don't think we get more than one opportunity to spend \$200 billion this poorly."

    body: "I'm in the very strange position of actually being able to run out and buy the latest Apple gadget, the super-tiny iPod Nano, if I wanted to. But I find myself actually in an even stranger position: I don't really want to."
    extended: "## Reason #1: It doesn't do anything my other three iPods don't do. ##\n\nI currently own a 15-gig 3G, a 30-gig Photo and a 1-gig Shuffle, and each of them has a useful purpose. The Photo's my primary iPod for both music and mass file storage -- I keep my whole life on it, basically, and use it both at home and at the office. The shuffle is a useful flash drive for getting data between places (especially in situations where there may not be an iPod cable or dock handy). And the 3G runs Linux.\n\nMy criteria for ever adding an additional -- or even replacement -- iPod to my arsenal would be whether it gives me some new feature(s) that make it worth the effort. And the Nano just isn't that great a deal for existing iPod owners _unless_ you never need more than 1,000 songs or 4 GB of storage space, or need something small and light badly enough that you're willing to compromise on capacity.\n\nThe Nano _cannot_ replace my Photo, and yes, I do need 30 gigabytes of storage on my person at all times. (Remember, I use it for work.) It could replace the Shuffle -- the Nano is really little more than a higher-capacity Shuffle with a click wheel and a screen -- but my Shuffle has a built-in USB connector, whereas I'd need to carry a cable to use the Nano with another computer. And as for replacing my 3G, we'll see about that whenever they get around to porting iPodLinux to run on the Nano.\n\n## Reason #2: USB 2.0 only? ##\n\nI can understand that leaving out FireWire on the Nano (while supporting the Dock Connector, so as to be compatible with the millions of extant iPod accessories) was probably a necessary compromise to bring her in at the price point and battery life they wanted. But my existing iPod connections are all FireWire, and I find FireWire to be the superior connector for all my connector needs. An iPod without FireWire is just, well, a Shuffle with a screen and a click wheel.\n\n\n## Reason #3: Innovation begets weirdness. ##\n\nA completely new Apple design usually means a completely new set of bugs, quirks and generally weird behaviors. This isn't to say that first-generation Apple products are bad, just less rock-solid than whatever follows them. For example, the iMac G5 was generally reliable and solid in its first incarnation but still had some problems here and there, whereas the second-generation models introduced this Summer are nearly perfect.\n\nAt the very least, if you can stand to wait a while Apple will always sweeten the deal: the second-gen iMac G5s came with Bluetooth and AirPort preinstalled, on top of all the other upgrades. Imagine what might be built into a second-gen iPod nano."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/09/obama.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"250\" width=\"150\" alt=\"obama.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em\" /> Barack Obama, the Democratic junior senator from Illinois (more specifically, Chicago's South Side) has just launched [a podcast](http://obama.senate.gov/podcast/).\n\nThis is major: not only is this a serious validation of podcasting as a means of reaching the people, but it's truly refreshing to see a politician using a medium with the immediacy of podcasting to speak directly to his constituents.\n\nDuring the 2004 campaign both candidates had blogs on their official sites -- after Democratic primary candidate Howard Dean used his website to such great effect building buzz for his campaign among internet mavens -- but they were seldom if ever updated by the candidates themselves. For all the talk about \"the internets\" last year, neither Bush nor Kerry ever really got it.\n\nObama gets it, however, and his podcast illustrates the thing that podcasting has over blogging: _the voice_. You can have an intern write your campaign blog and get away with it, but with a podcast you hear someone speaking to you, and hearing and recognizing a candidate or lawmaker's voice just feels more personal. Sure, all it means is that Obama took ten minutes out of his day to record some remarks -- which could have been prepared by the same intern who would otherwise be updating his blog -- for him to sit down and record for the website. But that ten minutes spent speaking directly to the people is important.\n\nFor one thing it's a podcast and -- as I've explained to students at my podcasting classes at [Digital Bootcamp](http://digitalbootcamp.com/) -- the important thing about podcasts is that they're (potentially) open-ended and ongoing. A speech or an interview is an isolated thing, and politicians can and do post speeches to their websites as MP3s. But to make such content available as a podcast RSS feed implies that Obama intends for this to be a regular thing, and the style he's chosen for his podcast -- bearing an awesome similarity to Roosevelt's legendary \"fireside chats\" -- gives the listener the feeling that this is a more personal message than we're used to from a politician on the national stage."

I'm using it on my work computer and I'll grant that while Mighty Mouse doesn't offer anything that my office-provided Logitech optical mouse doesn't, it just _feels_ so much nicer. It's the second awesomest mouse I've ever owned, second only to the [Logitech MX1000 Cordless Laser Mouse](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002UM0JW/demareesworld) attached to my iMac at home.\n\n(Of course, my office Mac is still running OS X 10.3/Panther, and Apple has callously refused to provide drivers for any operating system besides 10.4/Tiger, so I'm again using the terrific [USB Overdrive](http://usboverdrive.com/), which is totally worth the \$20 registration fee.)\n\nWhat's great about Mighty Mouse (compared to my old Logitech) is that its \"nipple button\" and \"squeeze button\" are so much easier on my hand than, like, actual buttons. Especially using the scroll nipple as a third button: this is the first scroll mouse I've used where I haven't felt like pressing down on the scroll wheel was going to do something unexpected, break the mouse or both.\n\nAnd having used Microsoft's Tilt Wheel and various other attempts at adding side-scrolling to a mouse, I can say that the Nipple? Best thing ever.\n\n_Photos coming soon._"

Gmail instant messaging, of course!\n\n[Google Talk](http://google.com/talk/) is basically a Jabber IM server for Gmail users, with a handy VoIP audio chat feature for those lucky enough to be connecting via the Google-developed client software, which is to say Windows XP/2000 users. However, since the text chatting is powered by Jabber (an open-source IM protocol) you can use any compatible chat software on any platform, including Apple's latest version of iChat AV (included with OS X Tiger).\n\nThe scuttlebutt is that there are no plans currently to make money directly from Talk; believe it or not, this might just be a cookie to get people to use Gmail. (Which is extra-funny, since Gmail is still invitation-only...unless that changes...sometimes soon...)\n\nWhich is good, because right now Google Talk is little more than an interesting side note to the awesomeness of Gmail.  While Jabber is readily available and easy to use, it provides absolutely no technical benefits over Skype or Yahoo (which have superior audio/video features) and totally lacks the ubiquity of AIM. If you start using Google Talk today, most likely the only people you know who'll have Jabber accounts are other Gmail users who probably already have an IM service they like.\n\nCase in point: nearly everyone I know has a Gmail account, but if I talk to them online I do it via AIM because everyone's been using it for years, or via Skype since people who hate text chat can just call my SkypeIn phone number to talk to me at home. Until Talk has some interoperability with one or more of the 800-lb. gorillas of IM, it's not going very far.\n\nSome good news, however, for Mac users: Talk's voice chat feature works on iChat 3.0, so the only feature missing from the Google Talk/iChat picture is direct integration with Gmail.\n\nNow if only I had somebody to talk to..."

    body: "Yes, yes, Birmingham was lovely, the service was lovely, there was lots of junk food and it was really, really hot. Now let us never speak of this again. Seriously, a sincere thank-you to everyone who came, helped us out and offered their support, emotional or otherwise.\n\nWell, maybe except this guy who posted to the Birmingham News's online guest book for my mom's death notice:\n\n> Thirty eight years ago Bonnie [my late mother] and I became man and wife. It was a first for both of us. Although it was a very brief marriage I feel like we parted friends. When Bonnie's mother was killed in the boating accident I was with her every day. When I told her after the funeral, I'll see you later, I didn't realize that I would never see her again. I am now very saddened by the fact that none of us in this life, especially her family, will see her again. But, in the hope that she died a Christian I'll close with \"See you later Bonnie.\"\n\nI'm less put out than I was on first reading of this comment (which is to say that I had previously not actually _read_ it) but given my knowledge of how this marriage fell apart I find myself (even as a non-Christian) gagging on _any_ implication that this guy's gonna be singing with angels anytime soon. But perhaps I'm just bitter. I've had a bad week and I'm still not sure how gracious I'm supposed to be.\n\n**Anyway,** as part of my process of diving back into routine, <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">Practicalmadness</span> is back and (guess what?) due for a Fall redesign. I'll be finishing up the move to the new server this week, then things will be made pretty(er). The Podcast will be returning soon, most likely during the first week of September.\n\n\n## One More Robot Learns To Feel ##\n\nCoping mechanisms employed so far by your Humble Narrator, the boy robot:\n\n* Made, organized, remade, re-organized list of upcoming bills\n* Cleaned out and reorganized Gmail account\n* Began working on projects I had put on hold over a week ago to dash down to Alabama\n* Renewed a domain name that was two weeks past due; unlocked, transferred and renewed for two years another domain name (this one, actually) that doesn't even lapse for another month\n* Reorganized my [Backpack](http://backpackit.com/), downgraded my service plan.\n* Coffee consumed: 20 oz."

    body: "There's something wildly disproportionate about what I came here to say -- _my mom died on Thursday, therefore our posting schedule may be reduced for the next few weeks_ -- but really, what else is there to say at this point except to tell you why there's _still_ no Podcast #3? It is easier at this moment in time to focus on administrative details than to allow in the full fucked-up forest of awful that will undoubtedly try to consume me utterly in the next fourteen days or so. Last-minute flights must be booked, funeral arrangements must be made, an apartment the family has rented for ten years must be catalogued and emptied out. At this moment, it is easier to seize on a single element like how the Worst Thing That's Ever Happened To Me will affect <span class=\"pm\">Practicalmadness</span>.\n\nWhat will follow will seem to some -- definitely to me -- like a community theatre production of _A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius_, with a few notable regressions from the text:\n\n* Instead of the luxy North Shore of Chicagoland, this plays out in a corner of a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama where the biggest features of the landscape are I-65 and the giant Wal-Mart that stands on the other side of it.\n\n* The over-analytical, over-educated young writer narrating the story will not tell about how he's become his young brother's only guardian and then moves to San Francisco to start a bothersome alternative press, but rather will pepper anecdotes about the aftermath of his mother's death with anecdotes about Krystal Burger.\n\n<span class=\"pm\">Practicalmadness</span> will continue a mostly-daily posting schedule (with a 60% chance of interruption due to severe travel-storms; high winds, hail and funeral planning are considered likely, says the National Weather Service); the podcast will resume in September."

    body: "As I'm busily scurrying about telling the world how much [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com/) is the bee's bizzatch, I often overlook the fact that I do business with another awesome web hosting company called [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/). See, TextDrive (which hosts Practicalmadness and [Stop Paying Attention](http://stoppayingattention.com/) for us) is great, but they're definitely advanced hosting for web pros, whereas Dreamhost (who host [The Velocipedist](http://velocipedist.com/), [The Dynamic Dynasty](http://thedynamicdynasty.com/) and [Fiendish Monsters](http://fiendishmonsters.com/) as well as the MP3 files for the [Practicalmadness Podcast](/extras/podcast/)) are easy-to-use, cheap and friendly as hell.\n\nThey're also extremely, refreshingly blunt when it comes to [talking about their business on their company blog](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2005/08/08/why-web-hosting-is-easy):\n\n> Web hosting is really competitive and yet still a very lucrative because it provides a value that is literally thousands of times the cost. For around \$100 a year, a business or individual gets a world-wide publication and communication tool thatâ€™s available all the time (*cough cough*) with zero effort. Twelve years ago, you could spend a billion dollars and not have something even remotely as great!\n\n> And yet, when you get to a certain size (like say, DreamHost size) the cost to provide that service is itty bitty. Our data center and network expenses, i.e. our â€œCost of Revenueâ€?, is about 5% of our total revenues.. and it drops every year. You can survive a lot of stupidity when youâ€™re able to mark everything up 2000%. Did you know in 2000 we had twice the employees we have now, with one fifth the revenues? Stupid! (Good thing that still put us at about a 50% margin!)\n\n> **Did you know we had TWO full time handymen for the office space we were _renting_? Stupid!   \nOne of whom did cocaine at his desk (yes, the repair guy had a desk) every morning? STUPID!**\n\nIn this post-political correctness age when most businesses who want to remain in business wouldn't admit to having hired a full-time employee who did cocaine while at work under substantial legal or journalistic pressure, _let alone publicly on their blog_, as part of an overall discussion of how much money they're able to make even with reduced staff and the most insanely competitive pricing in the industry...I'm like, _dude_, that's punk rock.\n\nWhich is why I'd like to _give away some money_ to entice you to do business with them. I have right here, in my pocket, a Dreamhost promo code valid for **free setup** on monthly plans and **\$79 off (in addition to free setup)** when you pre-pay for a year. Their basic plan costs about \$120/year, so that means you get a year of first-class hosting for \$40.\n\nInterested? Then [click here to visit Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?ddemaree) and, if you like what you see and decide to sign up, enter promotional code **JERKBERG79**."

    body: "For all the utopian futurism that those of us who still read _Wired_ end up swallowing every month, ultimately there remains the need to face up to the fact that for what used to be called the Third World the future is going to look a lot like the past, only with perhaps more bullets, more famine and more death. [Joshua Ellis](http://www.zenarchery.com/) wrote about it, [Jim Rossignol](http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=154) republished it and [Kottke](http://kottke.org/) linked it:\n\n> Feeding poor people is useful tech, but itâ€™s not very sexy and it wonâ€™t get you on the cover of Wired...The upshot of all of this is that the Future gets divided; the cute, insulated future that Joi Ito and Cory Doctorow and you and I inhabit, and the grim meathook future that most of the world is facing, in which they watch their squats and under-developed fields get turned into a giant game of Counterstrike between crazy faith-ridden jihadist motherf*ckers and crazy faith-ridden American redneck motherf*ckers, each doing their best to turn the entire world into one type of fascist nightmare or another.\n\n> â€œOf course, nobody really wants to talk about that future, because itâ€™s depressing and not fun and doesnâ€™t have Fischerspooner doing the soundtrack. So everybody pretends they donâ€™t know what the future holds, when the unfortunate fact is that â€” unless we start paying very serious attention â€” it holds what the past holds: a great deal of extreme boredom punctuated by occasional horror and the odd moment of grace.\"\n\nI really can't expand on the elegance and immediacy here -- there's no denying that there is an amazing disconnect between the world as we see it and the world that actually exists, and there is no sign of hope that this state of affairs will change anytime soon. The outside world has and does suck, and first-worlders did not and do not care.\n\nOr rather, are so themselves disconnected from the political and economic machinery that no degree of caring can be sufficient. A more paranoid individual than myself would be inclined to point out that there is toil and horror in Africa and merely toil here, and so that machinery has succeeded in teaching us to the difference between the United States and (e.g.) Sudan as merely varying degrees of the same boring bad, rather than totally opposite ends of all relevant spectra. That the powers that be _want_ the rest of the world to suffer horrors so that we can be shielded from them and thus willing to subject ourselves to whatever authority can promise that we won't be starving, racially cleansed, bleeding from all orifices, dying as if life were cheap.\n\nA more paranoid individual than myself would believe that this is the sociological equivalent to the old good cop-bad cop routine, where the bad cop tortures the rest of the world with these things, and the good cop can offer to protect us from the bad cop if we'll just offer our full and total cooperation.\n\nOf course, I don't believe that humans could ever be so cooperative to get together and plan a vast conspiracy to ruin a third of the world so as to keep the other two thirds in line. That's what makes me a cynic."

    body: "I don't know what magic mojo SBC did while I was freaking out at the office, but they should do more of it. **My internet connection at home has returned.** And I got a voicemail comment on the podcast!\n\nAs for questions of how I went from screaming at Comcast on Tuesday morning to enjoying my TiVo and broadband connection on Wednesday night, ultimately I have no idea what happened but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with Speakeasy working my order at the highest level of escalation, or Covad's India-based DSL install coordinators pressing the right buttons on their terminals, or that _one_ guy who installs DSL lines in Humboldt Park having plugged the thing into the other thing properly.\n\nWant to know more? Including some technobabble? You'll have to wait until after the jump.\n\n\n## From Seattle to Bangalore to Humboldt Park and back\n\nOf course, all the missed connections and miscommunication about this since last week leads me to fear that I'll come home to find that SBC, Covad or Speakeasy has turned my connection off for whatever reason, and so will reignite my fury of a thousand suns.\n\nThe problem with going with a DSL provider who isn't the phone company (or I suppose with a cable internet provider who isn't your cable company) is that the phone/cable company still owns the wires that come into one's building, and so while that phone company is legally required to allow competing companies to use those wires switching to another provider creates a new problem where the company you're doing business with (in my case [Speakeasy](http://speakeasy.net/), based out of Seattle) is having to do business with the phone company, and possibly other vendors.\n\nIn Chicago, Speakeasy lines are jobbed out to Covad -- Speakeasy provides the network service and handles the relationship between my home network and the greater internet, but Covad apparently handles the physical wiring and any communication with SBC. So any line problem I may have has to be filtered through three companies, whose opinions differ as to what \"the highest level of escalation\" means.\n\nFor Speakeasy, it means what it sounds like -- there's a human being whose job it is to proactively manage the installation process for one or more customers, who are reachable by direct telephone or e-mail. For most ISPs this level of involvement and customer contact is reserved for when things go completely wrong and a lawsuit is involved. That Speakeasy offers this level of service as common practice is why I'm paying a premium to have them rather than some other provider.\n\nCovad's primary business is DSL lines, but they cut more corners. According to my SBC guy, some/all of their technical support staff is based in India, and any line testing or verification that doesn't require physical inspection of the equipment is done remotely from ten time zones away. I shouldn't wonder if the reason my SBC guy showed up a day early is because somehow it got scheduled for August 10 _Bangalore time_, and there was simply a time zone-related clerical error _in India_.\n\nAs for SBC, well, my problems with SBC's service are well-documented.\n\nThat I was able to get online Wednesday night just means that everyone, ultimately, did their jobs and the Seattle-Bangalore-Chicago relationship works out just fine. However, it is my experience that customer service quality degrades over time, and this has held true at stores, restaurants, online merchants and utilities. So we'll see how this works."

Later I will try another way to get TiVo and Comcast to play nice, and failing that I will tell Comcast that, well, you know that \$64 I give you every month, Comcast? Uh-huh, no.\n\n**SBC,** who in addition to completely pooching my bill and making me progressively more angry over the last 90 days can't even tell time. They're scheduled to come out and bring The Velocipedist HQ back onto the internets tomorrow morning; they showed up today at 9:15 saying it was totally Covad who told them August 9. I'm sure that if I called Covad they would say nuh-uh, we told them August 10 and SBC pulled our hair and stoled our lunch money.

Then some asshole decided that they needed to change iTunes Essentials, and the monthly playlists were cut.\n\n_Or were they?_ They've still shown up from time to time, and now it seems they're a new feature called \"New Music Monthly.\" _But they are not linked from the home page and the vein in my forehead is going to explode!!!_\n\nIt's okay, though -- I have more. Veins in my forehead, that is."

    extended: "## The Migration Assistant and Me, Sittin' In A Tree ##\n\nYes, the [Migration Assistant](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/setup/) (the OS X Tiger utility  that automagically transfers data and settings from an older FireWire-capable Mac) really works. It takes about 90 minutes to transfer and import 80 GB of data, and as far as I can tell everything came over.\n\nThe only hitch: while the iTunes library from my old machine was carried over, it wasn't imported -- the new machine created its own iTunes library file and placed my old one in a folder called `Previous iTunes Libraries`. This could be because my old Mac is running iTunes 4.9 and the new one shipped with version 4.7.1, or it could be a roadblock to prevent music sharing.\n\nEither way, the fix is simple: just copy the `iTunes Library` file from that folder into the regular old `~/Music/iTunes` folder and your music will be right where you left it. Well, except, on a different computer.\n\nIn any event, if you have any music purchased from the iTunes Music Store (iTMS) you'll want to open and play that stuff immediately -- your iTMS authorizations _do not_ transfer from an old computer (they're keyed to your hardware). And if you don't have internet access (yet), you may want to avoid even connecting your iPod to the new machine until its iTMS authorizations are up to date.\n\nAnd I don't know if this is yet another recent update to the ITMS's content-protection features or if this is how it's always worked, but even if you have your iPod set not to synchronize music (as I have) it will _always_ update ITMS keys. So if you even so much as _open_ iTunes while your iPod is connected to a computer that isn't authorized to play Music Store songs, your iPod will lose the ability to play those songs until you can hook it to an authorized computer. Fortunately, my work computer is still authorized and I have my iPod's \"Open iTunes upon connection\" setting turned off, so this is only a minor inconvenience -- I just have to remember to eject my iPod before opening iTunes.\n\n\n## It's Not The Speed...Until You Try To Use Soundtrack Pro ##\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, or failed to notice, is the speed. Not that a 2 GHz G5 processor isn't blindingly fast -- it is -- but rather that for most of what one does with a computer, my old 800 MHz G4 was totally agreeable. It's only when I try to do some things that used to push the old machine to its limits -- like open more than one Adobe Creative Suite app at a time, or record multiple tracks in GarageBand, or display real-time effects in Final Cut Pro -- that the speed becomes apparent.\n\nThe same goes for memory: you only notice it if you don't have enough. My outgoing iMac has 768 MB of fairly standard PC2700 memory, whereas the new one has 1.5 GB of super-hot DDR 400 memory. So the memory is faster and there's more of it. You'd think I'd notice a huge increase in performance, right? Nope: the Finder still mysteriously beachballs for thirty seconds every now and again, Delicious Library is still not-so-deliciously sluggish and programs that were running smoothly before are still running smoothly.\n\nSame as with the processor, you only notice the benefits to extra memory when you push the computer to do really computationally intensive jobs, like video or audio editing.\n\nThere's definitely some hardware improvements, however, that are totally noticeable. The SuperDrive on the iMac G5 is far, _far_ faster than the one on my old Mac as is the hard drive, so copying files from a burned DVD-R back onto the hard drive or onto a FireWire device (e.g., iPod) is at least twice as fast. I haven't tried to burn a DVD on the new machine yet, but I imagine that this process that used to take 45 minutes will probably come down to at most 20-25 minutes. And the new machine came standard with some features I previously had to use external peripherals for (like audio input and Bluetooth) and some others I've never had (like dual-layer DVD burning and wireless connectivity via AirPort).\n\n\n## It's Got The Look ##\n\nI'd never have said this before I owned one, but the extra \$300 for the larger screen is totally worth it. It's not just that I can realistically use it as a TV (which I'm having to do now that my Mac is my only DVD player) -- while I was never really missing having an extra few million pixels of workable desktop space, it sure is nice to be able to have my Photoshop, BBEdit and Safari windows all mostly visible at the same time.\n\nWith the bigger screen comes a more powerful graphics card that supports Quartz Extreme and Core Image. There are some visual effects, like the Dashboard \"ripple\" effect or the live resizing of the viewer in DVD Player, that were simply never possible on my old machine. Mac OS X is smart enough to know that if a machine's graphics card can't handle those things then it shouldn't even attempt them, so I get _extra_ eye candy while day-to-day performance feels solid. In other words, while the Aqua desktop environment is designed intelligently enough that you don't _need_ the eye candy to use the computer, it's nice to have some extra chrome on the old Cadillac.\n\nAnd having finally seen the two machines -- an iMac G4 and G5 -- side by side, I am now totally in love with the aesthetics of the G5. I love the \"sunflower\" design of the G4 iMac, with its swiveling screen and semi-volleyball CPU, but the G5 is _so_ sleek and simple that it makes the old machine look like a country cousin.\n\nI guess the G5 follows the modern iMac tradition of high design sensibility that is on first glance a little alienating, but ultimately brilliant in the way such an articulately crafted piece of consumer electronics gear can insinuate itself perfectly into one's life and one's living space.\n\nIt's not just that the iMac matches my furniture -- and I did choose my somewhat impractical metal-and-glass desk because it just looked sexy with an iMac sitting on it at CB2 -- but that it's such a blank slate that it can just go anywhere. Like the monolith in _2001_, it's technology that doesn't look technological, but rather is so refined and perfect that it feels way, _way_ more advanced than things that look more conventionally technological."

    title: "Are You Happy Now?"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Here it comes to save the day -- the Apple Mighty Mouse is on the way."
    body: "A persistent cry of the insistent Mac hater is always that Apple's machines come with one-button mice, and like that's really dumb because don't they know that you could have a _two_ button mouse and things would be much cooler and like my mouse goes up to eleven?\n\nNerds, haters, Valley girls -- your prayers have been answered: the [Apple Mighty Mouse](http://apple.com/mightymouse/) is here. Five buttons, scrolling -- happy now?\n\nAesthetically, it's a multibutton mouse as only Apple could make it. The shape is identical to that of the Apple Mouse (formerly the Apple Pro Mouse, the standard one-button optical jobbie that ships with all Mac computers), and technically (yes) still has just one physical button.\n\nBut the surface of Mighty Mouse is like one big trackpad -- when you're clicking it detects whether you're putting pressure on its left or right side and returns the appropriate click action. So you still get the satisfying \"rocker\" motion of the Apple mouse without foregoing the multibutton goodness.\n\nAnd you know those little side panels that people often mistake for buttons? They are now buttons -- by default they trigger ExposÃ© and Dashboard, but can be programmed in System Preferences to do anything you want. So it's an embarrassment of button riches from Apple -- they've evolved from one buttons to _four_ buttons in a single day. (I should take this opportunity to point out that Mighty Mouse is _not_ replacing the Apple Mouse; it is a separate \$49 item that must be purchased separately from a new Mac.)\n\nPerhaps the coolest element of Mighty Mouse is its scrolling. Instead of a wheel or a vertical trackpad, it uses a little nubbin (like the pointing device from an IBM ThinkPad) that's pressure-sensitive, allowing very quick and easy 360Âº scrolling.\n\nIf I have any complaint about Mighty Mouse, it's the fact that it's not wireless. For all the innovation here -- and you can't say a device that combines all the benefits of a mouse and a trackpad isn't innovative -- it's still a corded mouse.\n\nThe cynic in me says that this is just because a Bluetooth version of Mighty Mouse has been delayed -- perhaps because it would have to be passed by the FCC, and Apple likes its product announcements to shock and awe, and so leaked details of a wireless version of an existing product won't sting as much as leaked details of a brand-new product. And so there will inevitably be a cordless Mighty Mouse, and Apple will charge more for it -- perhaps as much as \$79 (a \$20 markup over the wireless version of the Apple Mouse), which would put it in the same price range as high-performance gaming mice from companies such as Logitech. (My Logitech MX1000 -- a six-button mouse that uses a laser, rather than the basic optical sensor found in the Mighty Mouse, for enhanced accuracy -- usually retails for about \$79.99.)\n\nThis thing is undoubtedly cool, and should come for free with every Mac. That would certainly kill the haters' argument about the one-button mouse, and would be just one more point of distinction between Macs and regular PCs (especially now that Macs will be running on Intel processors starting next year).\n\nI can understand the economics behind making Mighty Mouse its own product -- why give away the milk for free when you can sell the cow, or something like that. It would be nice, is all I'm saying."

    body: "So it's a day that ends in 'y', and you know what that means! It's time to pick on [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/)'s movie reviews!\n\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/05/07/9-songs\" target=\"_blank\"><em>9 Songs</em></a></dt>\n<dd>Sex is often a significant part of human relationships, so why shouldn't films reflect that and depict it more accurately? That's the question director Michael Winterbottom tries to answer with 9 Songs, and he does so fairly successfully. The film is rated NC-17 and features fairly graphic sex (penetration, oral sex, bodily fluids), which was disappointing at first because I thought Winterbottom was using sex for the same purpose as most directors do (cheap titillation) but the choice made more sense as the movie progressed and, thanks in large part to the two lead actors, contributed greatly to the feeling of relationship in the film.</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n\nI will grant that this is much better than Jason's previous reviewing efforts (especially the one in which he was [so dazzled by truffle butter that he forgot to comment on the movie](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/06/that_yellow_bastard)), I'm sorry but the frustrated high school English teacher in me cannot allow any written material that opens with a thought like \"sex is often a significant part of human relationships.\" I read that, and my inner voice goes through a whole panoply of witty responses:\n\n* Duh!\n\n* Really, you think!\n\n* Just as oxygen and water are often useful substances to breathe in or drink, sometimes. (Provided you don't mix them up!)\n\n* Please fill out the following questionnaire: how frequently is sex significant to your social relationships?\n\n* Please fill out the following questionnaire: how frequently have you written or thought about truffle butter in the last twelve months?\n\nI could further use the ten years spent developing my critical eye for art (with a five-year concentration on film, cinema studies and the history of movie stuff) to take issue with the kernel of Kottke's thesis regarding _9 Songs_ to be that most directors use explicit sex for cheap titillation, and Winterbottom didn't, so this movie had a feeling of relationship.\n\nIn other words, I could list the number of overlapping gross generalizations in this one-paragraph synopsis of a film I haven't seen to poke holes in what is possibly a cogent summary of an element that was a single point of interest to the admittedly untrained eye of Jason Kottke, but I won't do that for the following reasons:\n\n1. Jason Kottke is cooler and has more readers than I do, so I'll just come off sounding petty and desperate in my attempt to topple what is now a veritable blogosphere empire.\n\n2. I'll most likely be distracted by something shiny before I finis--\n\nOoh, look! Tinsel!"

    body: "SBC Internet, having [pissed me off once previously](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/disconnected), have pissed me off for the last time. Last time on _David vs. The Phone Company_, our intrepid (yet totally evil, megalomaniacal) protagonist thought he had paid the bill, then learned that the payment had failed to clear (a fact which was never reported to me until _after_ the dialtone on my phone was cut off) and his phone line was shut off. He then had to wait six weeks for SBC's bureaucracy to agree that, yes, the internet was shut off and needs to be turned back on.\n\nThis week, my SBC Internet account has been shut off for non-payment of a \$200 early termination fee resulting from SBC's earlier screw-up, a fee which they said would be waived on request. This is a request I made two weeks ago, at which time I was told that SBC's home accounts collections department would be told not to shut off my service or anything until the \$200 credit to cover the \$200 charge I should never have gotten to begin with had cleared.\n\nDid this happen? Of course not. And so I'm saying so long to SBC. Fuck 'em. Starting next month, my new apartment will be outfitted with a dedicated ADSL line from [Speakeasy](http://speakeasy.com/), who are also providing me with inexpensive VoIP telephone service (unlimited long distance, baby! woo-hoo!) and (because I asked nicely or something) one free static IP address. I plan to use this static IP to be able to AppleShare into my home Mac from my office Mac, in the likely event that I leave some crucial file sitting in the well-organized system that is my desktop.\n\nMy experience so far with Speakeasy has been exemplary. I'm dealing with a sales rep and an \"installation coordinator\". I know them both by name. I have phone numbers and e-mail addresses for them. If I am just an account number or dollar signs to Speakeasy, they're hiding it _real_ well.\n\nWhat this means for you, Dear Readers, is that Practicalmadness's posting schedule will be somewhat curtailed during the month of August (at least until about Aug. 15-20ish), and then will be back to normal. The Podcast will continue to be un-updated and unloved until at least next week (although I think I might record a five-minute spot tonight to appease my eager, devoted fans). And my telephone service is _totally_ hosed until late August, since Speakeasy has to wait until the internet line is in place before setting up my voice service. Something about, like, _actually supporting E911_ and treating VoIP lines as just a really versatile, inexpensive landline.\n\nI like these guys."

    body: "[Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/), a regular target of my genial scorn and a true exemplar of the excesses of the blogosphere, is either really dumb or has a really dumb sense of humor. I can't tell which.\n\nThis morning he posted the following items to his [Remaindered Links](http://kottke.org/remainder/) linkblog:\n\n<blockquote><dl>\n\n<dt><a href=\"http://eserver.org/recipes/neiman-marcus-cookies.txt\" target=\"_blank\">A woman who was charged \$250 for a cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus gets her revenge by emailing the recipe to everyone she knows</a></dt>\n<dd>\"So here it is, please pass it on to someone or else or run a few copies...I paid for it, so now you can have it for free!!!\"</dd>\n\n<dt><a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/old-whats-new/whats-new-0693.html\" target=\"_blank\">The makers of the WWW browser Mosaic are keeping track of what's new on the WWW</a></dt>\n<dd>\"Carnegie Mellon has announced their Web server; here's the 'Front Door'; here's the home page.

I'm just not sure why. But perhaps it has something to do with the fact that in much the same way that podcasting began when iTunes 4.9 came out on June 29, the internet as we know it began ten years ago this month."
    extended: "\nThe commercial World Wide Web came into the public consciousness _fo shizzle_ with the Netscape IPO on August 9, 1995. Before 1995, the Web was a cool new toy for the ultra-geeky, a barely clickable black-text-on-gray-background medium that seems to have almost no connection to the Intarweb we know and love today. Since 1995 a browser war has been waged and won, thousands of companies have been formed and have failed while a few (Amazon, Google, Yahoo) have become part of our information landscape, and technologies have gotten hot and fizzled only to rise again in some new form. (Remember 'push,' which was the buzzword of the year back in '97 and '98? It's back in the form of RSS feeds and podcasting.)\n\nTen years ago, publications like _Wired_ said the internet was something everybody would have to use. Today, it's something everybody does use, but the path from the birth of the online media industry on that day in '95 to the day today when you can propose starting an online business and be taken as something other than a wild-eyed idealist or crackpot opportunist has not been a straight or smooth one.\n\nDoes anyone even remember what operating system they were using on that day back in 1995? (And don't say Windows 95: it didn't release until August 24 of that year.) Or what kind of computer? Back then, Packard Bell was still in the business. Gateway and Dell were players, but not half as big as they are now. IBM was still hawking OS/2, and Apple was on deathwatch (where they'd remain until Jobs's second coming in 1997 and the release of Mac OS X in 2001).\n\nIf you owned a PC in 1995, it may very well have been running DOS (possibly without Windows), or you may have still been using an Apple II or one of the original monochrome Macs. Most likely you were using a Windows PC, just like today, but we're talking about Windows 3.1 here. To launch Netscape, you'd have to find which group it was in in Program Manager, but first you'd have to find and launch your dialer software, assuming you had loaded `WINSOCK.DLL`. Setting up a Netscape IPO-era Windows PC for the internet was a technically complicated process; one of the biggest selling points of Windows 95 was that internet-ready dial-up networking software was included.\n\nThis anniversary means more than people realize, which is to say that it's about more than money. Our relationship to technology, and via technology our relationships to each other, have been drastically redefined in the last ten years. E-mail, IM and lower telecommunications prices mean that you never really have to say goodbye to anyone ever. By the same token, when the internet catches a cold it really is everybody's cold -- there's no such thing as a completely closed system, and nobody who doesn't interact with the network at some point in their daily lives.\n\nIt's a little bit overwhelming, actually."

    body: "Previously on _Rock Star: INXS_:\n\n* Less than sixty seconds after performing his world-destroying cover of Alanis Morissette's \"Hand in My Pocket\", J.D. Fortune earned glares of death from his housemates with a remark to INXS he knows and loves the band's songs more than his fellow contestants. This caused some drama in the _Rock Star_ Mansion, along with not one but many protestations by the other Rockers that, like, it's not even true because J.D. is too learning the songs. This does not change the fact that J.D. (who has settled nicely into the show's villain role) is either the Rocker to beat, or headed for a big comeuppance? _Which will it be?_\n\n* Tara, taking to heart -- and perhaps taking too literally -- the band's request that she show more rock attitude, she won a battle with Deanna to get to perform Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\". Her performance on last Tuesday's performance show scared small children with its metalness, and Tara found herself once again up for elimination. On Wednesday's live show she performed INXS's \"Mystify\" agreeably, and now her challenge is to pick a song that is not country _and_ not metal. _How will she confound the band this week?_\n\n* Deanna, meanwhile, made like the German parliament and gave a vote of no confidence to R.E.M.'s \"The One I Love,\" and performed it as well as she could given that she kinda hates the song. MiG loved his song -- Aerosmith's \"Walk This Way\" -- but got tripped up with the lyrics during rehearsal, and onstage the energy of his performance was muted by his obvious terror at flubbing a line.\n\n* Having been told by the band to be 'more melodic,' which is what INXS says to you when they really don't like you and are just giving you a hoop to jump through as a courtesy, Neal performed Bryan Adams's \"Summer of '69.\" He brought a guitar he played for a few seconds but was mostly carrying as a prop -- which I'm sure went over well with, you know, _the band_ that he's auditioning for. His weak performance landed him in the Bottom 3, he was asked for some melody and so he performed the band's \"Suicide Blonde.\" While his stage presence is formidable and his Jagger imitation without parallel, INXS opted to send Neal back to Williamsburg and whatever Stones tribute band he's been fronting, leaving his fellows in mediocrity -- Jessica and Tara -- to decide how best to pander to the band this week.\n\nOn Monday night's show, INXS's Garry and Tim held a clinic where they critiqued the first two weeks of performances. Ty (having been told previously that his style is too theatrical) was told that INXS is \"not a theatre band.\" Geez, and next they're gonna ask him to try being more melodic. Ty -- whose performances of \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Cult of Personality\" have been audience favorites -- decided to kick it _down_ a notch this week, and will be performing \"Everybody Hurts\".\n\nI take this opportunity to point out that MiG -- who left a starring role in the London production of the Queen musical \"We Will Rock You\" to pursue his dream of fronting INXS(??) -- was either not critiqued for his own theatricality, or the criticism was so polite and muted that it wasn't worth airing. I continue to believe that this whole _Rock Star_ competition is really a training camp for MiG, who is (just like INXS) polite, innocuous and Australian.\n\nBrandon -- who is this week's bearer of the \"not melodic enough\" mantle -- ended up with \"Tempted\" to perform tonight, and can't seem to make his voice perform the song in anything but a monotone. Note to Rockers: when INXS tells you to be more melodic, _it is a trap._\n\nSpeaking of trapped, J.D. made the impulsive decision that the song that would be most advantageous to perform would be \"We Are The Champions.\" His problem: Jordis also wants the song. So he spent what looked like the better part of a day pressing Jordis to let him have it. Finally, she gave into his insistence that \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" would _so_ be a much better song for her.\n\nAnd then we discovered J.D.'s achilles heel: he, like Wil, Brandon and Neal before him, has a very, very limited vocal range and _can't sing the song_. He tries desperately to get Jordis to switch with him, and Jordis (already feeling dirty enough having said yes to him once) refuses. He tries to trade songs with _anyone_ and has no takers. He is stuck performing \"We Are The Champions,\" a song that is totally wrong for him. (And Jordis -- whose repertoire so far has been driving rock tunes and power ballads -- has an upbeat song that she'll most likely sail through as usual.)\n\nSo what does he do? Once again, he decides to try to fix it in the arrangement, and suggests that the House Band work with him on developing _a trip-hop version of \"We Are The Champions.\"_ See, there's doomed, and then there's _doomed._ The editors decide to add insult to injury and play some outtakes of MiG performing an absolutely perfect cover of \"We Are The Champions\" over the end credits, then riffing on J.D.'s INXS comments from the previous week.\n\n\n## Week Three Scorecard ##\n\n* **Eliminated:* Neal\n\n* **Still Awesome:** Ty, Jordis, Daphna.\n\n* **Rising to Awesome Status:** MiG, Susie\n\n* **Still Hot, Perhaps Not Awesome:** Heather\n\n* **Doomed:** Tara, Jessica, Brandon, J.D."

    title: "By Any Other Name, It's Still A Cow"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Hey! You! Microsoft&#8217;s doing that thing again! What thing? You know &#8212; that thing! Where they distract us from how long it takes them to release a much-needed system update by pre-pre-pre-announcing a shiny new name for that update! To..."
    body: "Hey! You! Microsoft's doing that thing again! What thing? You know -- that thing! Where they distract us from how long it takes them to release a much-needed system update by pre-pre-pre-announcing a shiny new _name_ for that update!\n\nTo wit: Longhorn is no longer Longhorn. Longhorn is <a title=\"Microsoft Windows Vista\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.mspx\">Microsoft Windows Vista</a>.\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin:1.5em 0\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/07/windows_vista.gif\" alt=\"windows vista!\" width=\"354\" height=\"79\" /></p>\n\nThis may lead you to believe that Windows Vista is somehow different from Windows XP -- after all Vista is a word that evokes grand images of mountainscapes, and an intrepid figure gazing off into a bright, gauzy future. More importantly, Vista is a _word_. That exists. And has more than two letters. And stands for something.\n\nIt is important, however, to remember that just as Windows XP is Windows 2000 Professional with a new look and some useful security features removed so as to enable a new generation of Internet-enabled collaboration, communication and privacy-destruction technologies, Windows Vista will be Windows XP with a new look and a new version of Internet Explorer.\n\nIn other words, you're paying \$99 for some extra letters in the name, plus a shitty rehash of Firefox.\n\nPerhaps I protest too much. Let's look at the way Microsoft is marketing WinVista to see what _they_ say it's supposed to do. But first: does anyone else have the sudden urge to start calling it 'WinDixie'?"
    extended: "## Introducing Windows Vista&trade;: Deconstructed\n\n> Every day, millions of people around the globe rely on their Windows PC to manage their increasingly digital lives.\n\nRemember when all you needed at work was a pad, a pencil and a nice, hot cup of coffee? Huh. You do? And we haven't outsourced your job to India yet?\n\n> While familiar tools for managing digital information are powerful, today's world requires more.\n\nNever mind why the powerful tools for managing such complex digital information such as _those e-mails from your Aunt Shirley_ are no longer sufficient. We require that you give us more money.\n\n> In today's digital world, you want the PC to adapt to you, so you can cut through the clutter and focus on what's important to you.\n\nTranslation: We fixed an undisclosed number of the bugs in Windows XP, so that it works now.\n\n> Windows Vista enables a new level of confidence in your PC and in your ability to get the most out of it.\n\nOr, wait, I'm sorry -- those weren't bugs, nor were they \"issues\" or \"security vulnerabilities\" or even \"flaws,\" since Windows XP is perfect in every way. We know that it's perfect because everyone uses it, freely and _totally_ of their own will.\n\nSo clearly what Microsoft is saying is: the problem is _you_. You're a great <del>user</del> person, you just lack confidence in your PC. And you shouldn't, because your PC is just trying to help you. It wants to help you send e-mails and do your banking online. It wants to help you take advantage of this exciting opportunity in Nigeria and to ALERT: CLICK HERE TO INSTALL OUR POP-UP BLOCKING TOOLBAR POP POP POP HOT LESBIAN ZOO DOT COM GIRL ON GIRAFFE ACTION POP POP POP!\n\nSee? Your PC is your friend. It wants to help you. And Windows Vista will be an even better friend. You want to have friends, right?\n\n> It introduces clear ways to organize and use information the way you want to use it.\n\nWelcome to Windows Vista! Where would you like to go today? Would you like to sign into your .NET Passport account? Would you like to sign into MSN Explorer to get the latest celebrity news and MSN Music downloads? Would you like to organize your digital photos and post them to your MSN Spaces blog?\n\nNo? Okay. Would you like to search for files on your hard drive? Okay -- done, and here's a list of all the ways that MSN can make these files even cooler!\n\nWhat? You'd much rather just check your e-mail? Okay -- done. Here's your e-mail. Ooooh, nasty! You've got 1,572 new spam messages! Would you like to download an update to Microsoft OneCare Beta that will check your system for viruses, spyware and competing web browsers? Would you like to sign up for MSN Hotmail Plus with up to 2 GB of storage and enhanced anti-virus protection? Would you like to upgrade to the latest version of Microsoft Outlook?\n\nWait! Where are you going! I gave you your files and your e-mail! I was only trying to help you, you fucking ingrate!\n\n> It seamlessly connects you to information, people, and devices that help you get the most out of life.\n\nWelcome to Windows Vista! Can I synchronize your contacts, calendars and e-mail messages with your Windows Mobile Powered Smart Mobile Device?\n\nYou don't have one? Um, okay. Well...can I synchronize your music, photo and video files with your Microsoft Portable Media Center Entertainment Device?\n\nYou don't have one of those either?! My word, you are simply not with it, missus! Okay, okay, okay -- how about this: I'll record some TV for you, and later I can stream it to your Microsoft Home Media Center Extension Device or record it to a DVD-Recordable disk.\n\nWait...I don't sense...YOU _WHORE!_ You didn't order me with a TV tuner card _or_ a DVD burner! I bet you don't even _have_ a Microsoft Home Media Center Extension Device!\n\nHow can I be expected to seamlessly connect you to information, people and devices to help you get the most out of your digital lifestyle if you're just going to buy a computer and check your fucking e-mail? Huh? What, am I supposed to _magic_ you an internet connected cellphone-MP3 player-video-enabled-vibrator device?\n\n\n## Have it your way\n\nClearly, I have yet to forgive Microsoft for the abortion that was/is Windows XP Home Edition, pre-Service Pack 2. No single software release has done more to completely kill a platform and sour millions of people on the potential of digital technology than the blue and green monstrosity you're more than likely staring through as you read this. At the same time I should be _thanking_ Microsoft for finally(!) screwing up badly enough that Mac market share is finally peeking above 5% for the first time in fifteen years.\n\nBut Windows -- like the Mac, like anything -- is just a tool. Microsoft's aggressive marketing would have you believe that they are the _only_ such tool worth using, and so it's logical to assume as a social, human animal that if your experience with the one accepted tool is unacceptable, the fault lies with you. Clearly, says this line of thinking, you're simply not smart or young or experienced enough. Computing the Microsoft way tells you that you are disempowered, disenfranchised, uncool, stupid.\n\nWhy on Earth would people tolerate being made to feel stupid (or frustrated or weak or helpless) all the time due to inferior software?\n\nAnd I'll admit: I'm a zealot who believes that the solution to this problem, as it was for me and for a lot of people I know, is to buy a Mac. But I'll also concede that Windows has its advantages (especially for business computing) and that the Mac is not for everyone.\n\nI'm just starting the process of being angry now, so that hopefully by the time the lemming march to upgrade to WinVista begins late next year or early in 2007 -- Microsoft often omits dates from its product names as a way of quietly admitting that it'll be late -- I won't be quite so apoplectic when I start hearing how people who just want to check e-mail are being fed the line that they're doing something that \"requires Windows Vista or later\".\n\nWindows was a good solution once -- it can be good or great again. But when you can make a billion dollars by doing _nothing_ for your customers but change the name and fix the bugs that should never have been in shipping software to begin with, why would you even think about improving your product?"

    title: "\"Morning Becomes Eclectic\" is Now Podcasting"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "KCRW's acclaimed music show is podcasting \"selected sessions.\" Why some shows and not others? Why did it take so long? The short answer is: fear."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/07/mbe_podcast.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\" alt=\"mbe_podcast.png\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />Bringing those of us in the podca--, er, _RSS audio enclosures_, um, game one step closer to total domination of your music player, KCRW's acclaimed live music show [_Morning Becomes Eclectic_](http://kcrw.com/podcast/show/mb) has started podcasting \"selected sessions by unsigned and independent artists.\" You can subscribe to the _MBE_-cast via the shiny orange chiclet button on the show's website (linked above), or you can help perpetuate a certain company's control over this nascent format by [getting your iTunes on](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=76016777).\n\nThose who aren't big podcastees or who aren't familiar with _MBE_ may be asking: what's the big deal? Those who do partake of the podcast or who are fans of Nic Harcourt's show may be asking: what the hell took so long?\n\nThe short answer is: fear."
    extended: "KCRW is a listener-supported service of Santa Monica College in L.A., and while they are less dependent on government grants than most public radio stations they aren't exactly Clear Channel.\n\nThat's how they like it, but it does put them in a less-than-tenable position when it comes to doing things the major record labels wouldn't be happy about. And while it's a reasonable, cred-building thing for a major-label artist to appear on a highly-regarded _broadcast_ radio show, it's a harder sell to get labels (and frankly even the artists) to agree to what's essentially giving anyone on the internet a free, CD-quality live album by a major artist.\n\nThe whole argument that downloading is good for business has its flaws, and those flaws apply as much or more to podcasting. Putting stuff online can help people get more into music, which inevitably leads to those people buying more music. When you can sample before you buy, it does a lot to break down the barriers between your wallet and the labels' bank accounts. What's more, posting a single MP3 or podcast is cheap as free.\n\nThat kind of exposure makes sense if you're an \"unsigned or independent band\" -- there's no huge corporate marketing budget behind your record, no vast corporate ecosystem dependent on denying the fans access to your work until the very last minute. The corporate media industry's fear of giving it away is less about any kind of reasonable projection of expected lost sales, and more a deep unease about letting a genie out of a bottle.\n\nLet me give you an example: you know and I know that had the publisher of the _Harry Potter_ series released some or all of the latest book as a free, non-DRM protected e-book sample in the weeks leading up to the mad midnight release, we probably would _still_ have been out at midnight to buy the thing, and up till 2 AM that night reading it. We know that, and Scholastic probably knows it too.\n\nBut by leaving the genie in the bottle, they're assured of a blockbuster hit. By letting it out and letting the open internet download part or all of a work, the numbers don't necessarily change but they do get asterisked. The uncertainty factor is what publishers, labels and movie studios are afraid of -- online distribution can improve their sales, but it also can hurt them. The easiest decision is to leave things the way they are; the irony is that they're spending much more time and money trying to maintain the status quo than they could possibly lose by embracing the digital.\n\nAnyway, that's why _Morning Becomes Eclectic_ can't podcast every show they do: the digital-fearing music industry would never, ever let their artists come on the show again. The indie labels have less to lose, and so are more open to experimentation.\n\nI could somehow tie this into the [37signals](http://37signals.com/) team's whole thing about small teams being conducive to a better, more agile development process, but I'd rather move onto other topics that allow me to use words like 'chocotastic'."

    body: "Continuing my ongoing series of paeans to things, places and media that I love and think you should love too, here's a couple of short recommendations not necessary demanding their own full post, but well worth checking out.\n\n\n## Jerry's Sandwiches ##\n\n[Jerry's](http://jerryssandwiches.com/) is a little place on Madison Street in the West Loop that serves what are quite probably the world's finest sandwiches.\n\nYou can order from one of the three dozen combinations on the wall, or you can design your own sandwich. They have a wide, _wide_ selection of meats (including delicious marinated skirt steak, blackened chicken, roast salmon), veggies, sauces (most of which are homemade), breads...the variety is confounding, and the confoundment is compounded by their daily specials. Every day there is at least one special filling (like smoked barbecued beef brisket or fried chicken strips), and so the dilemma is always whether you should take the opportunity to try the special, try something on the menu you've never tried before or just to stick with an old favorite.\n\nThey've recently expanded their offering to include frozen custard, and their drink case is full of everything from Coca-Cola to Izze to Dry Cola to Sprecher to...the mind reels at the variety. The value's not bad either: for \$6.75 (tax included), you get a sandwich with whatever fillings you want, with no conditions as to how much stuff you can add -- I think the general rule is that if it fits on the bread, you can have it. That price also includes a side salad, which is usually a choice between fruit salad or cole slaw (both delicious), with a third special option often available. (If they have it, get the potato salad.)\n\nWhat finally filled the cup of my admiration to overflowing today was that I ordered the fruit salad for the first time, and _they ball their melon_. I've had sides of fruit before, but I have never ordered from a place that is so detailed in their preparations that they take the time to include perfect little melon balls in a simple fruit cup. I shouldn't have to tell you that it's perfectly fresh fruit, and delicious.\n\n\n## _Ruby Blue_ by RoÃ­sÃ­n Murphy ##\n\nOnce upon a time there was this band called Moloko, which was riding in the back of the trip-hop bandwagon back when Portishead were still making records. And they had a lead singer who sounded a _lot_ like Beth Gibbons, before Beth Gibbons went folk, and basically they were like Five for Fighting -- one of those bands that has a bit of fleeting success because they sound like another, far superior band.\n\nThat lead singer was RoÃ­sÃ­n Murphy, and while Gibbons has reacted to the apparent collapse of her band by retreating into a really, _really_ good folk album, Murphy is keeping the trip-hop flag flying by making a really good, really torchy, really trip-hoppy solo record. [Pitchfork likes it,](http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/m/murphy_roisin/ruby-blue.shtml) and you can [download it or sample it from the iTunes Music Store.](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=65648016)\n\nI've been listening to \"If We're In Love\" and \"Ramalama (Bang Bang)\" all morning. The former is a cool R&B number; the latter is an _aggressively_ strange bit of pop.\n\nThe downside is that I've only just now realized that Portishead are like the Fugees, only white, British and with much less drama. No, I don't think we'll be getting that new Portishead album anytime soon, no."

    body: "We watch _Rock Star: INXS_ so you don't have to. On Monday's night's show (which is the night of _Rock Star_'s three nights a week that's most like a typical reality show): The Rockers mourned the departure of creepy Jakob Dylan wannabe Wil by hanging around the Mansion and drinking. Which, judging by what we've seen so far is how they spend _all_ their time if they're not performing or jumping through reality show hoops with Dave Navarro.\n\nHey, speaking of which, Dave shows up wearing a feather boa and explains to the Rockers the benefits of \"peacocking.\" Then he leads them into a room of the house that's been turned into some kind of Museum of Impractical Clothing, curated by a woman Dave introduces as a stylist to the stars who has styled, among other clients, himself. That's why we had to beat you with tennis racquets.\n\nGary from INXS is also there to see how the young performers take up the challenge of finding a personal style that'll mesh with the band's distinctive look of leather jackets and sunglasses. It's hard to tell whether he's more horrified at Brandon's psychotic hippie style or at Jordis's utter refusal to have style. Susie, once again, is a mess.\n\nThe ironically-named J.D. Fortune, meanwhile, continues his blitzkrieg march onto our television screens and into our hearts by standing up for his decision to wear homemade t-shirts with such witty slogans as \"American Vital\". When you're a rock star, buddy, you can have someone else make those for you. With something other than masking tape.\n\nSince the \"reality\" portion of _Rock Star_ is only half an hour long, there's not a lot of time for anything else before the _real_ reason these rare moments of non-singing exist: the weekly song selection. Once again there are thirteen songs, and once again Mig (the adorably elfin Australian guy) is thinking with his heart rather than his brain, his vocal chords or his knowledge of the lyrics when he chooses a sentimental favorite: \"Walk This Way\" by Aerosmith. Which he loves, but has never performed. And has to absolutely master in, like, 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Tara (who found herself near elimination last week for her ill-concieved performance of \"Take It Easy\" by the Eagles) has decided to overcompensate by choosing \"Paranoid\" by Black Sabbath. The problem: Deanna, the only rocker there who can convincingly pull off a hard rock song, wants it too. Meanwhile, _nobody_ wants to be caught performing R.E.M.'s \"The One I Love\", a great song that every single person there is totally wrong for.\n\nDeanna decides to take one for the team and her fellow Canadienne, and lets Tara have \"Paranoid,\" convincing herself that there is _some_ way she can make \"The One I Love\" work. This is the woman whose introduction to the band was Janis Joplin's \"Piece of My Heart.\" She's doomed.\n\nOh, neat! We get to see them rehearsing with the House Band! Ahem. I mean, hark! Here is some more reality show content for me to icily disparage!\n\nJ.D. ended up with \"Hand in My Pocket\" by Alanis Morissette, and decides to do that thing the band loves, which is to, like, _collaborate with the band_ on the arrangement. We hear only a teeny bit of J.D.'s final arrangement, but it's already sounding like a highlight of tonight's performance show.\n\nTara comes in to perform \"Paranoid\", and she looks like she's rocking to save her life. Which is to say that it's apparent that she, taken out of the context of a reality show, would prefer not to rock, but is committed to rocking agreeably at this moment in time. Yeah, she's doomed.\n\nAnd speaking of doomed, Deanna just can't bring herself to _feel_ \"The One I Love,\" and asks the band for help. And they play it, and she has a Melissa Etheridge thing going on with her voice, and it actually works out all right for the song...until she decides once again that she can't feel it, stops and starts over a bunch of times. If she's up for elimination, she'd better hope she gets an INXS song she can feel.\n\nLike...hmm...you know, come to think of it, I'm not sure there _are_ any INXS songs that are right for this woman. In fact, I'm not sure why _any_ of these jerks are trying out to be the lead singer of INXS.\n\nThe question would seem to be: if you wanna feel like yourself on stage, do you wanna perform \"Paranoid\" or do you wanna perform \"New Sensation\"? Every night? For the rest of your life?\n\nFuckin' INXS. Why am I even watching this show?\n\n\n## Your _Rock Star: INXS_ Scorecard\n\n* *Still Awesome:* Ty, Jordis\n* *Still Hot:* Daphna, Heather\n* *Plotting World Domination:* J.D.\n* *Doomed:* Mig, Deanna, Tara, Susie (aka Our Lady of the Perpetually Doomed)"

Go Nemesis, it's your birthday, it's your birthday...\n\nAhem. In all seriousness, though, this was part of a larger discussion about this one guy's desire for improved documentation for Ruby on Rails, which is slowly morphing into a discussion about the very nature of documentation with an undercurrent of war(!) between design nerds (artist-coders) and computer science nerds. It's like a nerd fight with better clothes and only half the usual amount of pocket protectors.\n\nI'll update this post later as soon as I find a good way of linking to the mailing list thread, because some good points are being made. (Rails community: If you can tell me how to link to the thread \"Newbie: Anything like php.net/manual...\", leave a comment or e-mail ddemaree at gmail. Thanks!)"

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/07/rock_star.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"314\" width=\"231\" alt=\"rock_star.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" /> I will say this for Mark Burnett: Dude _knows_ how to put on a reality show. The new show from the _Survivor_ mastermind is [_Rock Star: INXS_](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/rock_star/), in which fourteen surprisingly good aspiring rock singers and one woman with an unfortunate predilection to massacre Dylan songs compete for the a high-profile gig fronting...80s-era Australian rock band INXS?!?\n\nGeez, Michael Hutchence's corpse has been cold for all of _eight years_ and they're already looking for a replacement. Whatever happened to dignity?\n\nIn all seriousness, regardless of whether you're particularly into the idea behind _Rock Star_, the first hour (which aired Monday night) was brilliantly structured. On most reality shows, the first night is all about getting to know the cast, getting some early hints at the epic personality conflicts to which we, the TV audience, will thrill as the saga progresses.\n\nAnd on a show about rock singers, Burnett understand that what we talk about when we talk about getting to know the cast is: _make them sing for us, bitch._ So he has them perform -- immediately. In true _Survivor_ fashion, almost immediately upon arrival at the fabulous _Rock Star_ mansion the contestants are told that they're to dust off their best song and get ready to perform for INXS, second-tier rock star Dave Navarro (who's here playing Carolyn to the band's Donald Trump) and whatever people answered yes to the question \"hey, how would you like to come down to the Mayan Theater and see some jerks compete to be the new lead singer of INXS?\"\n\nHow many people was that? A _lot._ (\"Tourists,\" says the girlfriend. \"Angelenos,\" snorts your humble narrator.)\n\nSee: we don't need no stinking montage of each contestant's well-worn road to glory, we don't need to spend a bunch of time lingering around their living quarters waiting to see who'll always put their finger in your face. We need ill-concieved cover versions of beloved rock songs by people who are alternately (and sometimes at the same time) gorgeous, clueless, fugly, manic, brilliant, dreadlocked, tiny-shirted -- we need _blood_, people. These people must bleed camp for our sins.\n\nThe format is ambitious: _Rock Star_ will air three nights weekly, with a traditional, edited recap of the week's events in the mansion on Monday nights, a taped performance by all the remaining rockers on Tuesdays (after which viewers can vote online or by text message to nominate people for elimination) and a live results show (with more performances) on Wednesday, on which somebody is booted by the band.\n\nThis week featured a double elimination, as Wil -- a John Mayer/Jakob Dylan wannabe from North Carolina -- simply failed to realize that 'you should quit staring at the racks on the girls in the first three rows and play to the _whole_ crowd' means, well, ibid. \n\nMeanwhile, Dana from Studio City, California found herself cut loose for royally screwing up Dylan's \"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\". Or, as INXS's Garry Beers put it, her choosing \"one of the greatest songs of all time, by the greatest songwriter of all time, and not do[ing] it perfectly\" may have backfired. I swear, the adorable Aussie diplomacy of these guys is one of the highlights of the show, even if we are denied a memorable catch-phrase every time one of the contestants is sent home.\n\nI mean, as compared to the other shows in the Burnett-o-verse...\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><em>Survivor</em>'s Jeff Probst:</dt>\n\t<dd>The tribe has spoken!</dd>\n\t\n\t<dt><em>The Apprentice</em>'s Donald Trump</dt>\n\t<dd>You're fired!</dd>\n\t\n\t<dt><em>Rock Star: INXS</em>'s Tim Farriss</dt>\n\t<dd>I'm truly sorry, but we feel you're just not right for our band INXS.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nSee? It has diplomacy; it lacks t-shirt appeal. _Unless_ we're talking about ironic _hipster_ t-shirt appeal, in which case a screen-printed t-shirt with a picture of Tim with the caption \"I'm truly sorry but we feel you're just not right for our band INXS\" would be just the ticket. Yes! It's perfect! I'll take five of them!\n\n\n## It's Better When You Can Tell The Butterfly To Go Fuck Itself\n\nHowever, this wouldn't be Practicalmadness without some non-constructive bitching, with some tech-industry geekery thrown in for good measure.\n\nCBS and Burnett have made a deal with MSN to host the online voting for _Rock Star_, as well as to sell each week's performances as 99-cent singles on MSN Music. MSN Music, which is based on Windows Media 10. Windows Media 10, which is _aggressively_ incompatible with the Mac. \"Plays For Sure\" my pale hairy ass.\n\nIf the _Rock Star_ performances were available through _any_ Mac-compatible means -- either via the iTunes Music Store or even as some kind of subscription service on CBS's own _Rock Star_ site -- they'd have gotten three dollars of my money this week alone.\n\nThis assumption on their part that Mac users only listen to public radio podcasts, indie rock and the new Billy Corgan album that most people seem to hate but which hipsters are determined to defend just to be contrary is only _partly_ true. Those are the things we'll _admit_ to liking, but in fact we will listen to any old thing.\n\nDid you _see_, CBS, the number of things in the blogosphere related to \"Since U Been Gone\" after Jason Kottke admitted he loved it? Do you realize, Mark Burnett, how much per capita disposable income we Mac users have laying around? _We pay Steve Jobs's feng shui bill, for fuck's sake!_ Let me give you money to buy songs from your show!!!\n\nAhem. I mean...MSN Music's DRM model is, uh, too, uh...\n\nUm, the redhead's hot."

    body: "So I've just installed [Movable Type 3.2](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/), which is said to be somewhat unstable but so far seems to be one of those \".1\" software releases that is rather disingenuously only three hundredths of a version number past the last stable release, and yet totally, amazingly different. (I must say, good jorb on the icons and UI, Six Apart folks!)\n\nOne of the new features of this release of MT is a junk folder for comments, and as some of you may be aware I've long agonized over the comments issue. To leave them turned on, to require authentication, whether that authentication should be powered by [TypeKey](http://typekey.com/) or by Reader Services, and the comments dilemma leaves me spending many a night crying into my vodka and crying to the heavens: **WHY?! WHY, SIX APART?! WHY HAVE YOU MADE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR NOBODY TO COMMENT ON MY BLOG?!**\n\nSo: with the prospect of some kind of Bayesian filtering going on in the double-secret background, I have decided to bid a tearful adieu to my efforts to prevent the utter absence of comments on this blog to be perpetuated. \n\nWait, am I saying that I am stopping trying to stop letting people not try to...sigh. Clearly I haven't had enough vodka yet.\n\nAnyway, comments are now open and turned on. If you spam me, I will junk folder you into the stone age. Please note that while I do not consider _all_ comments about Viagra to be spam, the reason we have the comments feature is for people to respond to the work -- not to leave personal messages for me. (Not that I don't love personal messages, but you can e-mail me with those. Wait, am I saying that I want you not to love never...more alcohol!)\n\nAnd yes: I am aware that the podcast is late. And yes, I am aware what that could mean. But you readers can rest assured that I love the podcast very much, and whatever happens, no matter what happens, your mommy and daddy -- er, your podcast and Humble Narrator, I mean -- will always love _you_.\n\nDamned fancy vodka. I always seem to run out of it on podcast night."

    body: "<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/07/podcast_stats.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"194\" width=\"397\" alt=\"podcast_stats.gif\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\nJust a little bit more, I promise. The image above are my aggregator stats for the last 24 hours ending at about noon on Thursday (provided by the fine people at [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/)), and things are picking up. I'm pretty sure that only one or two of these is me. I think the Jakarta thing could be iTunes's daily update (they did update this morning and are now showing \"All Your Body Thetans...\" as available for download), so somebody, somewhere is listening to the podcast.\n\nLet's shoot for _two_ listeners tomorrow, and maybe by the time I post episode #3 next Tuesday night we could even have four or five.\n\nFeel the excitement!\n\n\n## So you wanna make a podcast? ##\n\nSo enough about listening to a podcast -- how about making one?\n\n[Odeo](http://odeo.com/) is going to be offering some sweet-looking tools for creating a podcast via a web interface, thus fulfilling their apparent mandate as the Blogger of podcasting. But those tools are still a little ways off, and Podcast listeners should be aware that I think the audio blogging or \"voicemail\" podcast style to be an endangered species in the face of the slicker \"public radio\" variety.\n\nSo what you want to know is: how do you produce a slick, sexy podcast? How do you do it on the cheap, or even free-as-in-beer? And what's this RSS crap anyway?\n\nIf you're in the Chicago area with some nights free in August, I will show you. Once again, we are partnering with our friends at [Digital Bootcamp](http://digitalbootcamp.com/) to offer a three-part Podcasting class in the evenings. The dates and topics (and pricing) are still in flux -- there'll be a set-in-stone outline between now and the end of the month -- but the rough breakdown will be as follows:\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>Week 1: Basic Audio Production (6 hours)</dt>\n\t<dd>For people who don't know a Shure from a stick of Sure, for people who've done a little recording but aren't hip to this whole digital audio production thing, for seasoned engineers who for whatever reason don't know from GarageBand. This course will most likely cover the basics of digital audio, from recording (both studio and field recording) to capture to basic editing. We'll also probably talk about some of the important concepts behind digital audio, like bit rates, sample rates, formats and how knowledge of these things can help you make an awesome podcast.</dd>\n\n\t<dt>Week 2: Producing Your Podcast (6 hours)</dt>\n\t<dd>Now that we're beyond the basics, we're ready to begin putting our podcast together. I'll likely cover sequencing and editing using GarageBand, but in general enough terms that more seasoned audiophiles who'd like to use a more sophisticated tool such as Soundtrack Pro won't feel left out. We'll add some royalty-free music (with a quick discussion of the legal issues involved in using just any old MP3 as background music) and finally get to mixing down our project and encoding an MP3 and talking about the issues surrounding that.</dd>\n\n\t<dt>Week 3: Pick A Peck of Podcast Publishing and Promotion (6 hours plus the time it takes to say that three times fast)</dt>\n\t<dd>So we've got a ready-to-go MP3 file for our podcast and we're ready to send it out to the world. We're almost done, right? Not by a long shot. There are three letters that stand between us and victory, and those letters are RSS. What is it? How do I make it? That's the major topic of this week, but there are some other big ones, including using FTP to post your podcast MP3 to the web, setting up and using blogging software such as Movable Type or Blogger to manage and publish your podcast feed and using a free service like FeedBurner to see who's listening. Finally, I'll show you how to submit your feed to the top directories out there (iTunes, Odeo, et al) so your painstakingly produced podcast production can proliferate prodigiously.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nLike I said: dates and topics (and pricing) are still tentative, but if you'd like to get in on some of this fabulous training, click the link above and the people at Bootcamp will give you all the details."

    body: "Episode #2 of [The Practicalmadness Podcast](http://practicalmadness.com/extras/podcast/), \"All Your Body Thetans Are Belong To Us,\" is now online. And in it I make a radical suggestion: there should _totally_ be a podcast _call-in show_. And The Practicalmadness Podcast should be that show.\n\nHow we'll accomplish this: I have [Skype](http://skype.com/) voicemail set up at **(312) 324-0077**. You should call that number (_not_ toll free, sorry) and leave a message. And I'll respond to it on the next podcast. It'll be awesome.\n\nAlso in the works in the Practical-Velocipede-industrial complex:\n\n* Some kind of group blog, which could be accompanied by a group podcast, which could be facilitated by a group audio iChat orgy. Technology! Ha ha!\n\n* A way to make Reader Services less useless, since I've given up trying to make it tie into the comments on the blog. I'm thinking either some kind of collaborative social software that lets you tag and taxonomize your underwear, or some kind of collaborative social software that lets you tag and taxonomize images of men having sex with barnyard animals. Those are my two finalists.\n\n* Nottke.org, a site devoted to all things that are _not_ New York, _not_ the web and _not_ Jason Kottke. It's part of our \"Hypocrisy Initiative,\" kicked off this week as I both blogged (and podcasted) about Kottke's recent embrace of truffle butter popcorn, then proceeded to go to the movies and order Starbucks Coffee from the movie theatre _bar_. (And if it were the weekend, I totally would have ordered a cocktail.)\n\n* How is the form of a podcast determined? By me. And I say that they should consist solely of the sound of one hand clapping.\n\n\n## More on the podcast ##\n\nApparently Apple _does_ have a sense of humor about GarageBand, as The Practicalmadness Podcast is [now listed on the iTunes Music Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73907423). (It helps that I spent an hour iTuning up the RSS feed until it _gleamed_ with standards-defying namespacey goodness.) So the truly lazy among us can now subscribe to the podcast via iTunes by clicking on Podcasts, clicking on Podcast Directory, searching for `Practicalmadness` and clicking the subscribe button under my name.\n\nHowever, for people who don't use iTunes or who would perhaps appreciate a less circuitous path, I'll be adding some <a href=\"/about/podcast/subscribe.html\">\"How to subscribe to the podcast using [name of client software here]\" stuff</a> to the About pages, as soon as I put up the About pages.\n\nAlso: the feed is now being redistributed via [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/), and anyone who subscribed over the last week may notice their feed URLs being subtly redirected to a different site. FeedBurner is accomplishing two things for us: they're providing numbers on how many people are subscribed to the feed (and what aggregator software they're using), and they're aiding in the process of adding those pesky iTunes namespace tags so the Music Store will think I'm cool.\n\nI think I've got the server set up such that if you've already subscribed to the podcast, or if you should subscribe via one of the directories that have the old URL (like Odeo or iTunes), you'll still get all the latest content, plus a picture of the Spaghetti Boy."

    description: "No, I will not talk about why Practicalmadness was offline for five days or why the spaghetti boy has been replaced by some funny-lookin' guy in a suit."
    body: "...a-a-and we're back. Did everyone have a fun and fungly Fourth of July? Readers outside the U.S. may be amused to learn that on this date we celebrate our independence from the British by setting off small explosives constantly throughout the fucking day, in addition to the rather larger explosives we set off constantly around the fucking world. Yep -- America, we loves some bombs. Rockets red glare indeed.\n\nAnyway, no, I will _not_ talk about why Practicalmadness was offline for five days or why the spaghetti boy has been replaced by some funny-lookin' guy in a suit. I furthermore will not talk about why part of the page is in Latin all of a sudden.\n\nYes, I will talk about what's new:\n\n* A wider, brighter, more simplified layout, featuring clean, semantic XHTML and spiffy CSS. You may not care about this now, but after somebody gouges your eyes out with a sharp stick or butter knife or maybe that letter opener you got on sale at Staples the week before you quit getting mail from anyone but bill collectors -- gee, wow, dude, that was ironic -- you'll thank me for making the site more accessible to the blind and the deaf. Unfortunately, the dumb will still have to go and read Kottke.\n\n* A new server! Practicalmadness is now hosted with [TextDrive](http://textdrive.com/), which means absolutely killer performance across the board, even on my slow-as-a-tortoise-on-mescaline Reader Services login pages. Unlike certain other companies I do business with, TextDrive will _not_ pay me \$97 if you open an account, but they do donate half my monthly service fees to the ongoing development of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com/), both helping to ensure that a great open-source framework continues to improve and working towards a future when Rails collaborator/[Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/) inventor [Sam Stephenson](http://conio.net/) (who is a friend of a friend) actually sees some money from his awesome work on these projects.\n\n    And I cannot recommend TextDrive enough. They're affordable, they're powerful and they have spot-on Rails support. They're the real deal. Unless, of course, you don't need the real deal. In which case: [gimme \$97, bitch](http://dreamhost.com/).\n\n* I've taken the opportunity to fix up some of the structural stuff, making Practicalmadness easier to maintain and expand as we go into the site's _fifth anniversary_ this September.\n\nBut no, the work is not completely done.\n\n* I'm currently working on a method to tie Movable Type (my CMS) and Reader Services together, to allow Reader Services members to use their existing usernames and passwords to comment on the blog. (And to allow the thousands of TypeKey members to use their TypeKey IDs to play the Oscars Game and stuff.)\n\n* The sideblogs are a total mess.\n\nYes, the podcast was up the whole time and yes, you can have another one. (As soon as GarageBand quits doing that thing where I speak and hear myself speaking four seconds later.)\n\nNo, I will not explain my decision to dump lime green for burnt orange. Thank god, I feel no compulsion whatsoever to do _that_.\n\nAnd no, I haven't tested it with Internet Explorer. You're having problems? Bite me."

    body: "I have come back to complain that while [Jason Kottke][1] can be bothered to [post a review][2] of [Miranda July's][3] [_Me And You And Everyone We Know_][4], he apparently cannot be bothered to, like, post a _review_ of this movie everyone says is so awesome. He is rather more concerned with such so very New York things as _truffle butter_:\n\n> The auditorium we were in [at the new IFC Center] doesn't have stadium seating like most newer theaters do, but the sound was great and they've got digital projection...However, the butter from the concession stand only comes in two baffling flavors to top your popcorn: rosemary flavor and truffle flavor. We opted for the truffle and quickly wished we'd done without...popcorn that tastes like a side of mushrooms with your chicken breast is pretty yucky. Stick with the basics, gang.\n\nYes, Jason, I agree with you that truffle butter on popcorn is sort of like serving tahini and blackberry compote on focaccia and calling it a PBJ: it misses the point so gloriously that you need a certain hard callus of superiority to unequivically say that it is _wrong_. Because, you know, it's at least an interesti-- _NO_. It is truffle butter on popcorn. It is wrong.\n\nAnd yes, I think the experience of checking out a hot new theater with HD projection and a hot no-commercials policy and hot, hot truffle butter for the popcorn is probably so incredibly cool, and it kicks the movie's ass so incredibly hard that you can post something called a \"movie review\" that doesn't at all mention the movie.\n\nUltimately, this post is intended less to excoriate Jason for failing to mention the movie in his movie review, and more to get some kind of hypocritical lesser hipster thing going on regarding truffle butter. (Oh, and it was imitation truffle _flavor_, wasn't it? I forgot to mention that.)\n\nAs I live in a community where we think it's pretty hot shit to serve kettle corn and something called a \"fry cone\" at the concession stand -- and this is at the theater in _Evanston_, 45 minutes away by car -- I _will_ mock New York for its Kobe beef hamburgers and truffle butter popcorn. Everything will I mock. Everything!\n\nWell, except the [Shake Shack][5]. There is nothing funny about the Shake Shack. Man, I wanna go to New York.\n\n[1]: http://kottke.org/\n[2]: http://www.kottke.org/05/06/me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know\n[3]: http://www.mirandajuly.com/\n[4]: http://www.meandyoumovie.com/\n[5]: http://www.nyceats.net/photos/eats/shakeshack.html"

    body: "I've been an occasional contributor at [An Exquisite Corpse](http://anexquisitecorpse.net) since the site relaunched earlier this year, if by \"occasional\" you mean [that one corpse I participated in](http://anexquisitecorpse.net/crypt/2005/04/the_lightsflyin.php) and that other one that got sent to me while I was in Vegas that I couldn't complete.\n\nAnyway, I just got asked by the fates (if by \"the fates,\" you mean the computer program at An Exquisite Corpse that randomly assigns players to corpses) to _start_ a new corpse, and this is what I came up with:\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/06/corpse_141.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"200\" width=\"450\" alt=\"corpse_141.jpg\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\nI think it's an interesting image, if by \"interesting\" you mean...\n\nWell. I'm sure you can fill in your own ending to this joke. I'm already tired of it. I want to shoot it. This joke? Let me tell you about this joke. This joke _killed my brother._ It raped my sister and stoled my bible. This joke is a no-good, low-down dirty _varmint!_ A villain! A blackguard! This joke is more evil than the lame unfunny reference to the new Coldplay album I was going to make but thankfully did not!\n\nThe only solution is to kill it. It must die. And the only way to kill a joke, as we all know, is to overuse it. Tire it out. Ruin it for everyone, and while we're at it, overexplain it. Or maybe even spend two or three paragraphs going on about how horrible it is. Yeah, that's the stuff -- that'll make us never want to speak of it again. That will render it moribund, inert, puffed full of useless overlong adjectives and invective! Kaput! Deceased!\n\nEspecially if by \"deceased\" you mean..."

    title: "That's The Way To Do It"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "THAT WAS AMAZING! Like, the guy just _BLEW UP_ right in front of them! Next week we should definitely order Thai food!"
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/06/header.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"80\" width=\"185\" alt=\"header.gif\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />As some of you may be aware, I'm a [_Lost_][1] fan. Wednesday nights during the regular TV season are \"Lost Nights,\" when we watch that week's episode of _Lost_ and find ourselves speechless. Not because we've been struck speechless by the show, mind you, but because the participants in Lost Night -- myself, the girlfriend, [Crazy Eyes][2] -- are all experiencing it on totally different levels:\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>ME:</dt>\n\t<dd>That was pretty cool! And moderately diverting! Let's do it again next week!</dd>\n\t\n\t<dt>EMILY:</dt>\n\t<dd>This show is so frustrating! Why won't they show us a monster?! What the hell is up with those numbers?? So we're doing this again next week, right?</dd>\n\t\n\t<dt>CRAZY EYES:</dt>\n\t<dd>THAT WAS AMAZING! Like, the guy just _BLEW UP_ right in front of them! Next week we should definitely order Thai food!</dd>\n</dl>\n\nSo it's general (yet frustrating) enjoyment, mixed with Thai food and a lingering suspicion that no matter how crappy the show's attention to its mystery gets, we'll be back next week.\n\nBut it's not like it's _impossible_ for a TV writer to show some evidence that they do, in fact, have a plan. Take another new show with a lot of unanswered questions: [SciFi's _Battlestar Galactica_ remake][3]. The writer/executive producer of that show, Ronald D. Moore, has a lot of experience on shows that are ridiculous: he used to work for _Star Trek_. In fact, he was the sane half of the writing team that gave us the _Next Generation_ series finale plus the first two movies, then moved on to work on the only one of the five _Star Trek_ series I consider worth watching in my post-Trekkie phase, _Deep Space Nine_.\n\nAnd his approach to talking about _Battlestar_, in an industry where secrecy and surprise are key marketing tools, has been remarkably transparent. Whereas _Lost_ co-creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof are known to make the occasional vague, incomplete statement to _E! Online_ or _Ain't It Cool News_ with absolutely nothing to indicate whether they even understood the question, [Moore keeps it real.][4]\n\n<blockquote><dl>\n\t<dt>Fan Question:</dt>\n\t<dd>\"OK, How does the Six avatar on Caprica know Starbuck is Starbuck (during the fight in the museum in [the season finale])? Obviously she could get her rank from the uniform insignia, but how would she know her name? I didn't see a name patch on her fatigues or anything. Am I missing something? \"</dd>\t\n\t<dt>Moore:</dt>\n\t<dd>You're not missing anything. The methods by which the Cylons communicate with one another, the way they disseminate information and who has access to that information is something we haven't spelled out yet. There are answers, however, and as Season Two progresses, you'll learn more.</dd>\n</dl></blockquote>\n\nYes, in this exchange, Moore told us absolutely nothing concrete, but he didn't promise anything he couldn't deliver during Season Two (which starts July 15 on SciFi Channel) either. \n\n_Quick primer:_ The Cylons are robots, Number Six is the most-featured humanoid-looking Cylon and Starbuck is a fighter pilot from the titular starship. They're both hot chicks, and they had a fistfight in the season finale. I swear, the season-ending girl battle is as close as this series has _ever_ come to stooping to the level of its genre. Well, that and the space thing.\n\nThe question, parsed for implications using the knowledge of one who has watched all 15 hours of the new _BSG_ so far, is: _I suspect that the Cylons are capable of sharing information telepathically or over a computer network of some kind, and I want you to confirm or deny my suspicion._ Like Moore says, this guy isn't missing anything -- that Six would know Starbuck is something Moore left in the show on purpose as part of his apparent million-year mission to tell us only as much about his surprisingly mysterious robot villains as we need to know _that week_.\n\nWhile I'm sure the _Lost_ creators don't _need_ to start a blog to reassure us that this franchise is, you know, going somewhere, it would be good to occasionally get some evidence that Abrams and Lindelof at least know what the questions are. (That said, a blog would be nice. Hey! Jaybrams! Are you reading this! _We demand Lost blog!_)\n\nOn a vaguely related _Lost_ note:\n\n> During a radio interview for L.A. rock station KROQ, J.J. Abrams said that the network and one of the actors on the show couldn't agree to terms on a new contract and therefore the actor will be payed[sic] his desired rate for one or two episodes and then he said the actor will be killed off the show and won't be featured in any flashback sequences.\n\nUnless you believe the conspiracy theory that the Season One mystery storyline (the Others, the Hatch, the Numbers) was pushed up to November by ratings-hungry monsters at ABC -- and yes, there are people who feel strongly enough about this show to have formulated conspiracy theories about it -- this will be the first time that outside factors, like a contract dispute, have had any kind of impact on the arc of the show. It will be interesting to see how they handle something that could really throw a wrench into the creators' long-term plans for the show.\n\nAssuming that there _are_ long-term plans, and not just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.\n\nHey, and also? Go [here][5]. Look for a seating chart. Click on \"the numbers\". It'll be awesome.\n\n[1]: http://lost-tv.com/ \"Lost fansite\"\n[2]: http://stoppayingattention.com/ \"Stop Paying Attention, a comic by Lucy Knisley\"\n[3]: http://scifi.com/battlestar/ \"Official SciFi Channel site for Battlestar Galactica\"\n[4]: http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/04/index.html#a000025 \"Ron Moore's Battlestar Galactica blog\"\n[5]: http://www.oceanic-air.com/ \"Oceanic Airlines website\""

    description: "Now, when I say I have been \"without internet at home\" for a whole month, I mean of course that I've been without _broadband_ internet. Fast internet. Always-on internet."
    body: "I came home after a twelve-hour workday to find that -- surprise, surprise -- the red light on my DSL modem (signifying that the phone line has no DSL signal) is _still_ blinking. Today is my install date, and (if it is true that the DSL is still not working) this would be the third prospective install date the fine people at SBC have missed.\n\nBut just so I can say I had done it before calling to yell at them, I decide to check the cables, make sure everything is plugged in. And sure enough, _I had unplugged the DSL modem and microfilter_ weeks _ago_.\n\nAbout thirty minutes later:\n\n<div align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/06/yahoo_install_done.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"217\" width=\"413\" alt=\"yahoo_install_done.png\" align=\"\" /></div>\n\nMy internet first quit working in the early morning hours of May 2, and by the time I'm done typing this it will be June 3. Now, when I say I have been \"without internet at home\" for a whole month, I mean of course that I've been without _broadband_ internet. Fast internet. Always-on internet. I've had a dialup connection to use in the interim, but that's quite a lot of not the same. Several applications and services -- including some I pay a monthly fee for, such as Unison and Backpack -- became minimally accessible if accessible at all for a whole month.\n\nYes, nosy, I _have_ had broadband internet at work, and so the disruption in my life has been minimal. You could even say that using the internet _only_ at work has given my life a focus and balance that could not have been possible had I, like, _planned_ for it.\n\nBalls to that. I have my internet back.\n\nI've got some downloading to do."

The name should be familiar to longtime readers and close pals: [The Velocipedist](http://velocipedist.net/blog/). I posted [a nice, long welcome message explaining the philosophy and theme](http://velocipedist.net/blog/2005/06/welcome.html) of the new blog.\n\nSo going forward: no more complaints about [The Feather](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/ive_got_a_bridge_id_like_to_sell_you), no more long paeans to useful web apps like [Backpack](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/backpack_somewhat_useful_somewhat_mobile) and Gmail, no more [long-winded explanations of my development projects.](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/03/reader_services_the_next_generation) (In fact, since even [discussions of my design & development of _this_ site](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/tada_its_orange) are technically web arcana, that stuff will be on The Velocipedist too.)\n\nWhat you _will_ see more of: [snark about TV](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/in_soviet_russia_her_truth_handles_you), [snark about food](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/episode_iii_revenge_of_the_pancakes), [snark about music](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/02/beekeeper), [more snark about TV](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/predictions_for_tonights_season_finale_of_lost) -- the secret ingredient is _snark_.\n\nAll that, plus the podcast. Which _is_ coming later this month."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/ps_smart_objects.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"207\" width=\"182\" alt=\"ps_smart_objects.png\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />Finally: I've found Photoshop CS2's killer feature, and it's a doozy. See, while [I was aware of Adobe's Creative Suite 2](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/ive_got_a_bridge_id_like_to_sell_you) and had heard the phrase \"smart objects\" before, Adobe's _brilliant_ marketing for this release managed to let this feature slip past me, even as I acquired and installed this not-small piece of software onto _two_ of my machines. Of course, these are the same geniuses that gave us The Feather, so I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nAnd even if Adobe _were_ to start trumpeting it from every rooftop and hillside -- \"smart objects are coming! Smart objects are coming!\" -- I doubt that these clowns would have explained it in a way that I would have interpreted correctly. They'd have said something like:\n\n> Perform nondestructive scaling, rotating, and warping of raster and vector graphics with Smart Objects. Even preserve the editability of high-resolution vector data from Adobe Illustrator&reg; software.\n\nIn fact, [they did say that.](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/newfeatures.html#nf4) However, I would have cared if they had said something more like this:\n\n> Smart Objects are like pre-comps in After Effects, nested sequences in Final Cut Pro or nested movie objects in Flash. They allow you to (a) save a group of layers as a separate, editable file or (b) import graphics from other CS2 applications, like Illustrator, without actually converting and adding them to your Photoshop file. In either case, you can make changes to the originals whenever you want, and your Smart Objects will update instantly.\n\nThis is huge. Adobe's (of course) selling this feature on the grounds that it'll let you use vector files from Illustrator without destroying them during the import process, and I of course will certainly use it this way.\n\nHowever, pre-comps are where it's at. A pre-comp in After Effects is sort of a sub-project within your project. When you pre-comp something, you're saying essentially that a certain group of items are _always_ going to be together, and so you tell After Effects to treat them as such -- as a group. This both speeds up performance and makes projects easier to manage since you know that (e.g.) that lower-third title with the animated globe graphic is in _this_ comp file, and the bug that says \"LIVE!\" is in _that_ one.\n\nFor Photoshop, it allows such wondrous things as keeping a supply of smart object files for frequently-used assets, like buttons. Find yourself making the same button over and over again? Make it once, save it as a smart object and include it in as many Photoshop documents as you want. If you ever make a change to the smart object file, those changes will be reflected automatically in every one of those other projects.\n\nIs this the number one new feature in Photoshop CS2? Not according to Adobe: they list about four or five other features, including Vanishing Point and Image Warp transformations, ahead of Smart Objects on their spec sheet for the new release. And what is the number one new feature in Photoshop CS2, according to them that makes it?\n\nFuckin' [Bridge](http://practicalmadness.com/2005/05/ive_got_a_bridge_id_like_to_sell_you)."

    body: "In the grand tradition of making some over-specific pronouncement about my plans for this and other sites, then deciding to go eat mayonnaise instead of following through with them, I'd like to grandly pronounce my plans for this site for the latter half of 2005.\n\n* **Podcasts:** I'm working on the first of a series of Practicalmadness podcasts, which will be posted sometime during the month of June (I hope). I envision the podcast as my long-threatened sequel to the _Communique_: longish, occasionally brilliant, stuck in production hell for months at a time. If you've been reading me long enough to remember the _Communique_, _man_ is this gonna be for you. And if you've been reading me long enough to remember that _Communique_ is _not_ pronounced _comm-you-nee-kay_ (at least in this context), _man_ you've got to get a life. (At some point. Clearly I have not, or I wouldn't be bringing it up.)\n\n* **It's a day that ends in Y, so clearly it's time for a redesign:** Well, I'm gonna fix the color scheme. Light gray and chartreuse seemed like a good idea in theory, and this is not the time to point out that I am in fact altogether unschooled in color theory. We'll just take that as read, thank you, and look forward to a <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">Practicalmadness</span> that is 5-10% less insane. (Well, visually.) I also want to make the fonts a bit more consistent, focusing on super-readable serif fonts like Georgia (the body text font here for 2+ years) and Caecilia. And I redownloaded my original source graphics for Spaghetti Boy and David Nemesis, and I _do_ have a whole new Photoshop release to play with...\n\n* **Spinoff blog redux!** One of these days I will follow through on my threat to move my Mac posts to a separate blog. In the meantime, I have enough Gmail- and Backpack-themed entries in my drafts folder that I'm thinking the Web Arcana section should be spun off. So <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">Practicalmadness</span> will be the \"lifestyle\" blog (movies, politics, art, music, TV, food, dinosaurs with fanny packs) and this other blog will focus on the web stuff. Because after twelve posts about how much I love Gmail, it's time for me and Gmail to run away and consummate our passion. Um, I mean, to start another blog."

    title: "In Soviet Russia, Her Truth Handles You"

    description: "I must confess: I cannot handle her truth. MTV&#8217;s Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic (which debuted last Friday night) does accomplish one goal: I felt like I was up close and personal with mega-super pop tart Britney Spears, and that makes..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/britney_upn_013.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"242\" width=\"318\" alt=\"britney_upn_013.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />I must confess: I cannot handle her truth.\n\nMTV's _Britney & Kevin: Chaotic_ (which debuted last Friday night) does accomplish one goal: I felt like I was up close and personal with mega-super pop tart Britney Spears, and that makes me feel _dirty._ Wait, wrong tart -- it makes me feel toxic. Yeah, that's right. _Britney & Kevin_ is quite possibly the worst hour of television I've watched in a while, and yet it's totally compelling because it gives all of us a chance to watch Brit commit career suicide in real time, right before our eyes.\n\nOstensibly (hopefully?), the purposes of the show are to demonstrate what a loving, committed, non-skanky couple Britney & Kevin are, and also to steal some reality-show market share back from Jessica Simpson. It fails in both regards. Unlike Jessica & Nick Lachey, Britney & Kevin are utterly charmless. Britney is like a nine year old taking speed with a Starbucks chaser, full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Was I expecting some deep inner life of Britney, worthy of an overdone literary reference? Hell  no, but I was shocked to see the extent to which she is a girl, absolutely not yet a woman.\n\nAlso: Kevin Federline is a gold-digging, baby momma-abandoning piece of trash. Of course we all knew this, but I mention it again because this show, _which is executive produced by Britney Spears & Kevin Federline_, never makes him out to be anything but skank. Britney spends a lot of time talking how she's thinking a lot about love and commitment -- this partly because she says every dumb thing that pops into her head while she's on-camera -- and yet at no time is there any evidence to combat the belief that Kevin joining Britney on her European tour was anything but a multi-city booty call.\n\nSo the show fails as an image boost for Britney & Kevin. It also fails as reality TV, because unlike MTV's other, better reality shows based around the lives of the stars (_The Osbournes_, the aforementioned _Nick & Jessica_) this one is _shot by_ those stars. They gave Britney, her assistant, her boytoy/husband/co-executive producer and some of the dancers and handlers Sony camcorders, and that footage (intercut with more high-gloss material from Britney's shows plus _lots_ of establishing shots of London) makes up the bulk of the program.\n\nAnd these people? They can't handle a camera. If _Blair Witch_ made you sick, you do not want to watch this program on anything larger than a 19-inch television. You will regret it. Well, if you're watching this show long enough to get motion sickness you probably regret it already just based on content. But you'd, uh, regret it more."

However, since when have you known your humble narrator, the man they call David Nemesis, to be diabolical? So read on, dear (uh) reader, secure in the knowledge that clicking on the boldface text will get you absolutely nowhere.\n\n* <a onClick=\"javascript:document.getElementById('lostQuestion01').style.display = document.getElementById('lostQuestion01').style.display == 'none' ?

Not to mention really, really stupid, since Harold Perrineau is awesome and his character's arc is only just beginning.

What happened to Oceanic Flight 815 has something to do with the island, the numbers and/or the great mystery at the core of this show. We will get some clues as to that tonight. Actually, the answers to why or how the plane crashed are just one small detail in the overall tapestry of this show. (Or just one more minor plot thread to be used as a red herring so we don't ask so many dumb questions, like why they went eighteen episodes without so much as mentioning the monster. Or whatever happened to that thing where Jack's dad was back from the dead and on the island. Or even what happened to Jack's marriage. Fuckin' Jack. I hate him. What was I talking about? Oh, right.) I think we'll probably get some concrete answers as to why the plane crashed. Although they might be _Matrix_-level specific rather than, you know, _actually_ specific. That is to say, not specific at all, but still expected to end the discussion for now.</span>"

    body: "Non-Chicagoans or Chicagoans who eat _traditional_ breakfasts may not be aware of Orange or their amazing \"pancake flights.\" Ever heard of a wine flight? Or a vodka flight? Where you get several small portions of the stuff in question, all from a certain region or organized around a certain theme? The pancake flight works the same way. It's four small stacks of silver-dollar pancakes, each done in a different way according to that week's theme.\r\n\r\nThis week's theme is _Star Wars_.\r\n\r\nMentioned previously the _Star Wars_-themed pancake flight at Orange, I have. I sense many questions in you. Great hunger also I sense. You seek the pancakes! Want my backwards Yoda-talking ass to shut up and get on with the pancakes, do you?\r\n\r\nWell, fine. But you have until Friday at 3 PM (Orange changes the pancake flight on Saturday mornings) to go to either branch of Orange (Clark & Belmont or Dearborn & Harrison) to enjoy the Sith-y goodness.\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n\t<tr valign=\"top\" align=\"center\">\r\n\t\t<td width=\"50%\">\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 2px solid #666;padding-bottom: 5px;margin-bottom:5px\">Darth Vader Dark Chocolate Cakes</div>\r\n\t\t\tCakes topped with a Rich Chocolate Ganache, Garnished with Chocolate Covered Raisins\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"50%\"><div style=\"font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 2px solid #666;padding-bottom: 5px;\">Wookiee Cookie</div>\r\n\t\tPeanut Butter Sauce, Brown Sugar & Sugar Coated Berries\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t<tr valign=\"top\" align=\"center\">\r\n\t\t<td width=\"50%\"><div style=\"font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 2px solid #666;padding-bottom: 5px;\">Yoda Soda</div>\r\n\t\tGreen River Soda Reduction Garnished with Green Apple Puree & Candied Apple Peel\r\n\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t<td width=\"50%\"><div style=\"font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 2px solid #666;padding-bottom: 5px;\">Jedi Juice</div>\r\n\t\tLuke is a Fruit!

Let's not bicker and argue about why I'm here. Let us instead enjoy one another's company during this brief moment of togetherness.\r\n\r\nHey! Wanna hear something geeky? I'm currently putting together something I'm calling \"Rails in a Box.\" It's a collection of all the source code distributions and documentation needed to install Ruby, Rails and FastCGI onto your Mac's salty, Unixy underbelly! Isn't that neat? Huh? Huh?\r\n\r\nOkay, okay -- you don't wanna hear about that stuff. You wanna hear something fun, like what's in Orange's _Star Wars_-themed pancake flight this week. Or what I thought of _Episode III: Revenge of Hayden's Hair_. Or whether I think _Batman Begins_ will _rawwk_, and whether Emily concurs. (I do, and she does.)\r\n\r\nYou will get these things. But not now. Later. I have other things to attend to now.

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I&#8217;ve been playing with Adobe Creative Suite 2 all day, and it says a lot that two years after the release of the original CS package I&#8217;m finally over the fact that the Photoshop icon is now a feather. All..."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/cs2_menu_extra.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"30\" width=\"70\" alt=\"cs2_menu_extra.gif\" align=\"left\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0\" />I've been playing with Adobe Creative Suite 2 all day, and it says a lot that two years after the release of the original CS package I'm finally over the fact that the Photoshop icon is now a feather. All right, Adobe? You won. I bitched and I moaned, and the Photoshop icon is _still_ a feather. So fine. I'll let you have your feather and your seashells and your ridiculous nature conceit.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot in good conscience let you get away with repackaging the Photoshop file browser as a revolutionary new addition to my workflow.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/adobe_bridge.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"250\" width=\"200\" alt=\"adobe_bridge.gif\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />I'll admit it -- I _like_ Bridge, your new file browsing, Stock Photo-purchasing, batch-renaming, iPhoto-on-steroidsing machine. I kinda dig that it's really little more than bits of iTunes, iPhoto and the Finder forced to mate at gunpoint with the aforementioned Photoshop File Browser, and I can even put up with you trying to sell me image assets that (I agree) I really ought to be paying for if I'm gonna use it in a project.\r\n\r\nBut honey, your _performance_. You're making iPhoto 2 look svelte. There's absolutely no reason why a new Photoshop release (and a bloated, somewhat buggy one at that) should be running circles around an _image browser_. Maybe it's just all those proprietary Adobe display routines -- neither QuickDraw nor Quartz exactly -- not really certain where they fit into my OS X Tiger world. Maybe it just feels icky about browsing little more than goofy news photos and a porn collection, the same way that C-3PO feels icky working within a hundred yards of Jabba the Hutt.\r\n\r\nNow, that being said, here's what I like:\r\n\r\n* Unlike the old Photoshop 7 and CS file browsers, Bridge has no problem with any stripe of OS X-generated PDF or screen capture. (In the case of screen captures I'm sure that's because the jerks at Apple changed the default format from a lossless PDF to a very, very lossy PNG.)\r\n\r\n* Really, really robust and easy-to-use batch renaming, with an iTunes-like \"smart\" interface and impressive speed. And yes, I know I just complained that Bridge is slow. The interface is slow here as in all the CS2 apps, but what's going on under the hood is good old Adobe professionalism. I see myself using this feature lots and lots.\r\n\r\n* <img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/bridge_filmstrip.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"200\" width=\"160\" alt=\"bridge_filmstrip.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />The filmstrip view, which isn't totally dissimilar to iPhoto 5's edit, slideshow and book views except that you're browsing the regular filesystem (no crufty iPhoto folder trees!) and have a large measure of control over what's going on. And in general, the iPhoto-ness of Bridge is a welcome thing. Granted, it's a little unfortunate that Adobe's first _real_ push into making an asset-management app seems aimed at photographers and such who've been using iPhoto for fear of getting iView or Portfolio all these years. But for those of us who just need to keep some shit organized without intermingling it with their personal stuff (as stored in iPhoto), Bridge is awesome.\r\n\r\n* It's free with any CS2 app, so it's not like you're having to pay actual money to try it.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual meat of Creative Suite 2, so far I haven't noticed much to write home about. They made some unnecessary visual tweaks to the classic Adobe interface (read: they changed how palette tabs look in Photoshop), and that's a little unsettling. Smart Objects are kinda exciting -- potentially revolutionary -- but I'm not totally sure yet how they'll change my admittedly pedestrian web graphics workflow.\r\n\r\nAnd they haven't killed ImageReady yet. I tell you, that's almost as big a puzzler as-- _A FEATHER? WHY IS THE ICON A FEATHER?!_\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 2em 0\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/photoshop_icons.png\" border=\"0\" height=\"59\" width=\"400\" alt=\"photoshop_icons.png\" align=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\nPass the Tylenol."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/backpack-logo-login.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"69\" width=\"84\" alt=\"backpack-logo-login.gif\" style=\"float:right;margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />The folks at Chicago's own [37signals](http://37signals.com) last week unveiled their latest web-based application, [Backpack](http://backpackit.com/). Which is basically a friendly-to-the-masses redo of their business-oriented project management product [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/). In other words: it's a really, really, _really_ elaborate to-do list.\n\nI've been keeping some of my own reminders and to-do lists on Backpack since the launch last week, and it's kinda useful. It's one of those services that one could use but doesn't necessarily _need_; I haven't yet had a \"eureka!\" moment where I find I'm now able to do something that I couldn't have done before Backpack. But having Backpack available to keep track of stuff is agreeable, and (like everything else coming out of 37signals) it's certainly an exemplary example of website craft.\n\nThe killer feature is the ability to update one's Backpack via e-mail, which combined with the just-announced mobile access essentially makes Backpack a magical PalmPilot in the sky for anyone with a web-enabled cell phone, Treo or Blackberry. You use a special, spam-resistant e-mail address (e.g., cletus43joebob@yourname.backpackit.com) to post new todos and notes to a given Backpack page, then use your device's web browser to view what's already there. This could be quite cool.\n\n_However,_ unlike the mobile versions of some other services (such as Yahoo! or AIM) that use the older, more limited but more compatible WAP language for pushing stuff to cell phones, the guys at 37signals decided to use mobile XHTML. And let me tell you: the total accessibility thing is still a dream of the future. My Sony Ericsson's web browser is technically capable of reading XHTML, but wasn't able to display the simple form submit button. Making the login page, and Backpack Mobile, pretty much useless to me.\n\nHowever, I have found an interesting use for the Mobile version of the site: I set up a JavaScript bookmarklet that opens Backpack Mobile in a tiny window of its own (<a href=\"javascript:window.open('http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/05/backpack_mobile_screen.png','imagePopup','width=400,height=464,toolbars=no')\">screenshot</a>), letting me view and tick off todo items without interrupting my work in the main Safari window. Of course, doing it this way means I'm relating to Backpack as just a normal web page, not a spiffy Ajaxed web application (similar to my beloved [Gmail](http://gmail.com/)), which _almost_ defeats the purpose of using Backpack at all.\n\nBut hey, it's free.\n\n__Update:__ [Rael Dornfest](http://www.raelity.org/) wrote to ask what should have been an obvious question: how to set up a Backpack bookmarklet.\n\nThe code for the bookmarklet is:\n\n`javascript:window.open('http://ddemaree.backpackit.com/mob', 'backpack', 'toolbars=no,width=400,height=450'); return true;`\n\nJust replace my Backpack username, `ddemaree`, with your own to make it work for you. In fact, if you want to just try it out and get a taste of what Backpack is like when it's really, really small and non-responsive, <a href=\"javascript:name=prompt('Enter your Backpack user name:','ddemaree');window.open('http://'+name+'.backpackit.com/mob','backpack','toolbars=no,width=400,height=450');return%20true;\">click here.</a> You'll be prompted for your Backpack username, then taken to your Backpack Mobile site. (In this context, can I call it a Backpacklet?)\n\nI know it works in Safari 1.3; there's no reason it shouldn't work in any other browser that likes bookmarklets (such as Firefox or IE6)."

    body: "As of Monday morning, my phone service has been cut off. And so we are proud to present the David's Phone Has Been Cut Off FAQ:\r\n\r\nh4. Have you been done wrong by a corporation run amok, operating outside the boundaries of common decency and human behavior?\r\n\r\nYes and no. The series of unfortunate events leading up to the disconnection of my voice/DSL line _began_ with me failing to pay a bill, but since then the ball has been in SBC's court. I mean, they _could_ have called to ask for their money, which I would have given them. Sadly, they like messing with me more than they like money. Me, I'd have chosen the money. I'm not very interesting when messed with. Boring, really.\r\n\r\nh4. Can it be fixed?\r\n\r\nOf course..._for a price._ And that price is...well, nothing, since I paid the phone company and got them to waive all the You've Been A Late Bugger surcharges. However, you could say they have stolen from me my most valuable asset: high-speed internet piracy at home. The soonest my internet can be re-activated is _May 17_. Bastards!\r\n\r\nh4. How does this affect me?\r\n\r\nWell, if you're reading this, then clearly you have a connection with the author of this site that transcends the usual bond between website author and website reader. Translation: You probably know me personally, and assuredly will be hearing me bitch about not having internet at home every moment of every day that we're together until the SBC gods smile upon me once more.\r\n\r\nFurther translation: I will be coming to your houses to mooch internet like _all the time_ for the next two weeks.\r\n\r\nh4. Will this affect the Adobe-Macromedia merger, or the astonishing adoption rate of open source web application frameworks like Ruby on Rails?\r\n\r\nIn all likelihood, no. But it will affect your capacity to be bored by them. My already-abbreviated posting schedule will now be abbreviated further, from \"never posts\" to \"never posts _for a reason_\".\r\n\r\nAs for what is clearly your next question, about whether the hiatus on %{font-variant:small-caps}Practicalmadness% will have any impact on the Department of Killing Open VMS: Mike, you know, we _can_ leave these things at work, dude.\r\n\r\nh4. Will this post ever be accompanied by a funny photograph, perhaps even a photo-illustration of the %{font-variant:small-caps}Practicalmadness% Spaghetti Boy photoshopped into some compromising position or gender?\r\n\r\nNot until May 17th it won't be."

    body: "Before I resume radio silence to finish some of the million things I have to do before work, a couple of small things:\n\n* [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org/) is back from the dead, with a website redesign and some new features in the nightly builds. Camino, for those of you with memories shorter than two years, _used to be_ the best web browser available for the Mac. It's a Mozilla-based browser, just like Firefox and (well) Mozilla. Unlike those apps, which are cross-platform, Camino is strictly a Mac product. It was doing the standalone browser thing almost a year before Firefox first came into being. Unfortunately, Safari and Firefox happened, Camino development slowed down and now has gone from being the most popular Mac browser not made by Microsoft to a footnote.\n\n    I have some reservations about the current state of Camino -- e.g., it doesn't support as much of the CSS stylesheet specs as Safari, and its pop-up blocker doesn't always work -- but at any rate it's faster than Firefox and similarly reliable. It's sponge-worthy.\n\n* Moby and The Decemberists have new albums today. I just downloaded Moby's, [Hotel](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=50721688), from iTunes where they're offering an exclusive(!!!) bonus track.\n\n    I downloaded the Decemberists', [Picaresque](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=41350072), from Usenet weeks and weeks ago. [This makes Colin Meloy cry,](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2005/01/colin_meloy_on.html) but I will assume some bullshit posture about how information wants to be free and my \$13 doesn't. Failing that, I will whine that I love the band's quality drumming, and now that the band's drummer has quit I'm just going to have to listen to them 'on spec' until the _next_ album comes out. I've just had my heart broken by Tori Amos too many times to let another band treat me this way."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Tonight, fulfilling my duty as a loyal-to-the-_hilt_ Tori Amos fan, I picked up her latest and I found myself playing a strange game."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/02/tori_beekeeper.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"229\" width=\"190\" alt=\"tori_beekeeper.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />Tonight, fulfilling my duty as a loyal-to-the-_hilt_ Tori Amos fan, I picked up [_The Beekeeper_](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=45445572), her latest. And as I was using a computer at work to load it onto my iPod shuffle, I found someone had loaded up the new CD by Chicago indie rocker-comix artist [Archer Prewitt](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=41758602) and so I grabbed it for listening on the way home.\r\n\r\nAnd I found myself playing a strange game where an unfamiliar song would come on and I would guess: \"is this Archer or is this Tori?\"\r\n\r\nThat I could even play this game made me realize a sad truth: Tori is off her game. The songs on _Beekeeper_ are solid, still in the same vaguely alterna-pop vein as her last record, 2002's _Scarlet's Walk_. Moreso, really: whereas _Scarlet_ was deceptively pop and proved, on subsequent listens, to be one of Tori's richest albums (and on listens subsequent to that to be deep in a very shallow way), so far there's nothing really remarkable about the new one. When I hear a nondescript pianos-and-electric guitar intro and have to wonder whether it's Tori or another, completely different artist, there's something seriously wrong behind the prison town.\r\n\r\nNow iTunes is playing her duet with Damien Rice, which sounds almost exactly what you'd expect from the generic concept of a duet with Damien Rice: a ballady song sung in a pleasing, forgettable way. But this is _Tori_. We expect more from Tori because, well, she's nutty as a fruitcake but has a troublesome history of making flawed, extremely interesting work.\r\n\r\nApart from that unmistakable voice, an accent somewhere between English precision and Southern molasses, there's no stamp on these songs to say that it's her. Change the singer and this could be a Rachael Yamagata record, albeit one with really fucking spectacular piano work.\r\n\r\nHow do you know Tori's off her game? If you find yourself really digging a song of hers _in the moment_ with no lingering scars or memories from the one before it, if you can enjoy it as pop music without any of the baggage that comes from being in such a decidedly unique emotional space, that's how you know. You know in the same way that you meet someone you know very well, and after a few exchanged words immediately know that they're hiding something from you.\r\n\r\nAnd it's something little, something personal but not that personal, something really not worth sharing in the final analysis. But it means that she, your friend, has de-friended you to a certain extent. You're not even privy to her _minor_ secrets anymore. A once-intimate relationship reduced to the gentle patter of coworkers or casual friends or friends of friends.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the point where Tori, an artist I know very well through the work, is as easily accessible as an artist I've hardly met. Like Archer."

    title: "I See London, I See France"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "With all this focus on chihuahuas and massive online security vulnerabilities, it's nice to know that the porn blogs can focus on the true heart of this story: that that is _totally_ Paris kissing a girl while naked."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/paris_hacked.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"198\" width=\"197\" alt=\"paris_hacked.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" align=\"right\" />I am here today to do something that all of you, I'm sure, thought would never happen: I am going to discuss something Paris Hilton-related on Practicalmadness. Lest you go completely starkers from the high degree of cognitive dissonance, be reassured: I'm only doing it because there's some geekery involved.\r\n\r\nIf you keep up with rumors on the internets, you probably know that Paris's beloved T-Mobile Sidekick II cameraphone-PDA thingy was hacked over the weekend, granting some online malcontents access to her phonebook (and the celebrity phone numbers contained therein) and some naked photos of herself.\r\n\r\nThat Paris was, ahem, overexposed is nothing new. You may recall the ruckus raised about 18 months ago when a tape of Hilton having sex (filmed in the glorious glow of night-vision, creating all sorts of unfortunate comparisons between a Hilton and a raccoon) was leaked online, becoming the hottest illegal download since Madonna's fake _American Life_ MP3s. What's interesting this time around is the absolutely brainless way in which her T-Mobile account was accessed.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it to [O'Reilly Network's Brian McWilliams to explain](http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/01/01/paris.html):\r\n\r\n> Despite repeated attacks on her T-Mobile email and telephone records in recent months, the actress and heiress has persisted in using her chihuahua's name to secure her password at the T-Mobile site.\r\n\r\n> Like many online service providers, T-Mobile.com requires users to answer a \"secret question\" if they forget their passwords. For Hilton's account, the secret question was \"What is your favorite pet's name?\" By correctly providing the answer, any internet user could change Hilton's password and freely access her account.\r\n\r\nTo clarify: no handlers or trusted friends selling a shady videotape under the table, no master identity thief stalking Paris for months looking for an opening only he could exploit. This was perpetrated by someone who had watched _The Simple Life_, like, _once_ and happened to know how to reset a T-Mobile password. This was perhaps the first hack in recorded history where being stupid was practically a requirement.\r\n\r\nAnyway, with all this focus on chihuahuas and stupid passwords and massive online security vulnerabilities, it's nice to know that the porn blogs  (not that I read them) can focus on the true heart of this story: that that is _totally_ Paris kissing a girl while naked.\r\n\r\nThat's hot.\r\n\r\n### On A Related Note ###\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/images/2005/02/paris_sidekick1a.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"143\" width=\"175\" alt=\"paris_sidekick1a.jpg\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/) has [an interview with someone at NYCPeach](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/danger/paris-hilton-hacked-nyc-peach-imterview-033797.php), the company that takes the latest in high-tech gadgets, tricks them out with Swarovski crystals, rhinestones and sequins until they look like Liberace's been assimilated by the Borg, then sells them at massively inflated prices to the rich and fabulous. Such as Lindsay Lohan's iPod mini, and this picture of _one of_ Paris Hilton's many now-compromised Sidekicks.\r\n\r\nAnd lest you think a day should go by without some kind of Paris-Gets-Hacked-related t-shirt, _worry ye not!_ Check out [PreShrunk's \"PARIS MADE ME CHANGE MY NUMBER\" t-shirt](http://preshrunk.info/2005/02/paris-made-me-change-my-number.php) and start working on your explanations of the joke for two weeks from now."

    body: "Thirty-nine days, _twenty fucking people_, ten seasons, forty-four minutes of...surprisingly good television. Over the past six weeks since _Survivor: Vanuatu_ ended with highway worker Chris Daugherty besting highway worker Twila Tanner for the title of Sole Survivor Of The Most Boring _Survivor_ Ever, I've been on about how my favorite show simply cannot survive its latest gimmick. That gimmick is a massively huge cast of _twenty_ fame-starved Robinson Crusoes, backstabbing each other for a million dollars.\n\nPrivately I have said it. Publicly I have said it. On the subway, apropos of nothing, I have said it: _Twenty people? IT WILL NEVER WORK!_\n\nNow I understand Mark Burnett's secret plan: vote out two of them in the first fifteen minutes, while still voting one out in the last fifteen minutes, so that by next week there's only seventeen new faces I have to tell apart. Basically they had a mini-immunity challenge where the first man and first woman to shore not only guaranteed themselves a place in the game, but got first pick of tribemates. Then, after all twenty of them lived together in peace and harmony for about twelve hours, came the Survivor Draft, where contestants took turns picking each other to be on teams, and the last man and woman picked were automatically voted out.\n\nYeah, about that? Never have I been so glad about anything on television as I was to see that Wanda, a lady who came on _Survivor_ having written the most irritating songs ever written _about Survivor_ with a dastardly plan to sing them at the top of her lungs for hours at a time, was not going to be a fixture of my weekly viewing. I can put up with many things. I can even handle the occasional Kate-centric episode of _Lost_. But every man has his limits.\n\nAnyway, on to David's **List of Good Things And Bad Things About This Edition of _Survivor_, As Judged From A Single Forty-Four Minute Segment Of It:**\n\n**Good: The Cast**  \nFrom the Vegas showgirl with frightening tree-climbing superpowers to the scheming hairstylist to the adorable punk chick with the tattoos to the dude with the unfortunate Virginia accent, there is truly something for everyone in this _Survivor_ cast. Plus, no more hackneyed \"battle of the sexes\" crap! This season's theme: youth vs. experience. So far, youth sucks.\n\n**Bad: Survivor Still Not Likely To Win Anything From The NAACP**  \nAt least this show, which is somewhat notorious for advancing a stereotype of black men as lazy and black women as either Jesus freaks or ball-busting Amazons, has shown some progress: one of tonight's most prominent figures was a black female attorney...who also happens to be a ball-busting Amazon. And who was also the first person voted out. (Well, if you don't count the two losers who didn't even make it past the first day.)\n\nIt was awfully disappointing -- you know, culturally -- that the first Tribal Council found the youth-centric Ulong Tribe deciding whether to vote off either the strident black woman or the cute, non-threatening tattooed punk rock chick. How about one of the several nondescript white boys or girls who I'll spend the next couple of months trying desperately to tell apart?\n\n**Good: Well-Designed Challenges**  \nThe first challenge is one of the best I've seen in ages, combining the physical (an obstacle course) and the strategic (teams had to choose what part of their reward they wanted to carry with them to the end of the course) pretty brilliantly.\n\n**Bad: Sure, Fuck With The Flow Of Play _Some More_, Why Dontcha?**  \nFour _Survivor_ seasons ago, in the Amazon, this was a game with a relatively simple structure: two teams of eight people play as teams for about 20 days, then ten individuals play against each other for about 20 days. Last two are put to a vote, the one with the most votes wins.\n\nNow, with so many people on the show and so many twists, exceptions and general fuckery, you have to have been watching _Survivor_ since roughly Marquesas to understand how the game works. The twists and super-sized tribes have been known to sometimes make up for a lackluster cast, but it's frustrating when you have what appears (so far) to be a decent cast that we'll have no chance to get to meet until half of them have voted each other off.\n\n**Good: Damn, Those Are Awesome Islands**  \nYou come into a season of _Survivor_ thinking, \"damn, if I've seen one island I've seen 'em all.\" But you would be wrong. The islands they're filming on are all absolutely gorgeous, moreso than any other place the show has been before. It doesn't have the vague menace of Thailand or the, uh, volcanoes of Vanuatu, but damn these islands are pretty.\n\n**Bad: What The Hell Is With All The Army Crap?**  \nI get it. Palau was the site of some of the biggest battles of WWII. So the new logo, the bandannas, the Tribal Council set and most of the props have to have some kind of military theme. Is the thought process supposed to be, \"war is hell, and game shows are a somehow comparable form of hell?\" Or perhaps, \"game shows are awesome and so is war, by which we mean awesome!\"\n\nI am willing to accept great amounts of crap from this franchise. Hell, I even got excited about _Survivor: Vanuatu_, or as the early promos led me to think of it, _Cannibal Survivor_. I thought that after _Pirate Survivor_ (aka _Survivor: Pearl Islands_) there was a future in themed editions of the program. But even I, a relative political moderate, find this Army-themed Survivor a little bit disturbing. I mean, when you can't get decent TV coverage of the war we're fighting right now, how appropriate is it to have a war theme on a fucking reality game show?"

    body: "With regard to my earlier post about maybe having the Oscars Game ready this weekend..._damn_ am I good.\n\nI believe I made reference to having written last year's code so that it could gracefully be ported over for use this year. I got home at 8:30 PM, and by the time of this writing (at 12:33 AM) I have the database completely populated with 2005 data (using last year's abstraction and structure, conveniently exported from phpMyAdmin on one server to phpMyAdmin on the other, and last year's data-entry scriptlets with only minor modifications to adapt them to their new environment). I have a login script ready to go, with all of last year's account information. I have a Smarty templating system integrated into all of this, so that the last and most important bit -- making it all usable and pretty -- will take no time at all. In short, I was able to re-create two weeks of work, all done on a completely different server I had spent a few _months_ configuring and tweaking, on a new machine in about four hours.\n\nSo why not start the game tonight? Two reasons:\n\n* It doesn't look _pretty_ yet. And I am not about to sacrifice my reputation for _pretty_, especially since this will be most Practical readers' first exposure to the new site.\n\n* It's late enough and I'm tired enough that all that gibberish above about data entry scriptlets and templating systems actually sounded interesting and exciting as I was typing it.\n\nSo like I said: Oscars Game. Coming later this weekend. E-mail <ddemaree@gmail.com>."

    body: "From my window I'm looking down on the lawn in front of Roberto Clemente High School. It's not the lawn as it is right now, covered in at least a foot of snow, but as it has looked: gray-green with no leaves in the trees.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/clemente-winter.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"200\" width=\"450\" alt=\"clemente-winter.jpg\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\nThere are groups -- no, <i>processions</i> -- of students...not high schoolers but young kids. They're leading animals with ropes around their necks. Sometimes the animals are just students dressed as animals, and sometimes the animals are real. I recall seeing a bear suit, a fox suit and at least two live cows. The ones in costumes are almost always walking toward me, the real animals almost always walking away towards the hospital.\n\nI hear the \"Ghost Rider\" ringtone, a ringtone I am convinced exists only in my dreams and which is associated eternally with Clemente High for some reason. I don't know how I came to call it the \"Ghost Rider Ringtone\" -- I think at some point I decided that it was the music from a movie about the comic book called Ghost Rider, in which a flaming skeleton on a motorcycle avenges the innocent. I move to silence my cell phone.\n\nThe sun is golden against the walls. I am standing in front of \"Kingdom Hospital\", which is St. Mary of Nazareth around the corner from my house. I know why I call it Kingdom Hospital: because it's creepy. Kingdom was the name of the hospital from a miniseries Lars von Trier made for Danish television about a haunted hospital; it was later remade by Stephen King into a bloody stupid American series about a haunted hospital. I call it Kingdom Hospital because of its bizarre architecture. It's a pale concrete structure, and there are these huge ducts and vents protruding from the sides into the air. It's a single monolithic structure: it's not one of those hospital complexes with several medium- to large-sized buildings. It's just the one big building, oddly shaped, with those damned vents. It doesn't seem like a place where people go to be healed. It seems like a factory.\n\nIn retrospect it seems like this is more of a playset or movie set version of the blocks surrounding my house. It's all done in broad strokes, with not as much distance as there should be between Kingdom and my house, between Clemente and my house. I'm not home, I'm in a representation of my home. I find my Bluetooth headset on the sidewalk, and thinking it's garbage I throw it away. I realize what I've done and I pick it back up.\n\nHalfway back to my apartment, and as I'm walking back I see my messenger bag laying on the grass, empty and covered with water as if it had been rained on, abandoned for days. At this point I notice that the Ghost Rider tone is coming from the hospital behind me, rather than from home. Or that it's coming from all directions, mocking me. The cell phone is not at home or in the bag or in my pocket. The bag is not just empty -- it's contents have been <i>stolen</i>, or the bag has been stolen, its contents taken and the bag left. I'm thinking, \"I left the bag at home. <em>Oh god!</em>\"\n\nI run home. A neon green <em>EVICTED</em> sticker is in my front window and the door is open, and in my mind I begin bargaining. <em>I paid the rent, why are you doing this? If I do x, will you not do this? If I do y, will you not do this? What can I do, will you not do this?</em> I run into the house, just into the front door where I hear movers taking things out of one of the apartments. The sounds are coming from my downstairs neighbor rather than my place, but at this point I know better than to trust which direction a sound is coming from. I walk in, and at this point I wake up."

    body: "<img src=\"http://gadgetaus.com/pics/usb-charger-nokia.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"145\" alt=\"USB plugs\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float: right\" />I am currently wondering -- and maybe someone out there can tell me more about this -- whether it is possible to have a single device that can power, charge and maybe even serve as a battery backup for both my iPod (a 20 GB Click Wheel model) and my Ericsson T610 cell phone.\r\n\r\nI currently carry around the FireWire cable and wall charger to my iPod (in case I need to make a quick reset), as well as a USB charger cable to my phone. I sometimes also have the wall adapter to that USB cable, so I'm always carrying two cables and at least one power supply.\r\n\r\nI'm intrigued by the possibility of using [this new USB power charger from Apple](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70503/wo/GR5UDXSvF7xK2CscA8D2kvsErMD/3.0.0.11.1.0.6.9.2.11.0.7.4.0.1) to charge both gadgets, since iPods can be charged over USB and there's no reason to expect that such a device wouldn't also power my phone.\r\n\r\nWhat's really intriguing are the possibilities presented by this [new Apple USB backup battery pack](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70503/wo/GR5UDXSvF7xK2CscA8D2kvsErMD/3.0.0.11.1.0.6.9.2.11.0.7.3.0.8) for the new iPod shuffle, which takes two AAA alkaline batteries and turns them into USB current. The question is whether that current would be sufficient to power things other than an iPod shuffle, such as (oh, I don't know) a full-size 20 GB iPod with Click Wheel and a T610 cell phone.\r\n\r\nThat I spend this much time thinking about this stuff is somehow symptomatic of some deep void in my life. I choose to blame society."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/hiphopgirl.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"250\" width=\"150\" alt=\"hiphopgirl.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />I bring you more prime examples from the internets of people who have Missed The Point Entirely.\n\nFirst, _Essence_ Magazine announced a \"take back the night\"-style [campaign to protest misogyny in hip-hop](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0112/p11s01-almp.html). Then they ran [some reactions from hip-hop luminaries](http://www.essence.com/essence/themix/takebackthemusic/whattheyresaying.html) such as Russell Simmons. Yet on first glance, it seems less like these hippety-hoppers are in concurrence with _Essence_'s new feminism and more like they're saying \"it ain't me, and even if it was, that just how this business is so it ain't nobody's fault.\" In other words, they found that hip-hop has Missed The Point Entirely:\n\n> **Talib Kweli, hip-hop artist**  \nVideos can be art, but the video didn&rsquo;t start out as art. It started out as a promotional tool...So what&rsquo;s the easiest way to sell something? When you drive down the street you see titties selling you all types of things...so why not use ass and titty to sell music? It makes perfect sense. Whether it&rsquo;s right or not, I feel that as a man, when I see it, I&rsquo;m going to look. It&rsquo;s going to catch my attention. I believe an artist&rsquo;s responsibility is not to uphold the morals of society. An artist&rsquo;s responsibility is to speak honestly about what&rsquo;s going on and what people are going through.\n\n**Translation:** Ass and titties sell. And besides, it's not my job to be a role model, just to speak honestly about what I see. Thus I imply that what I see is ass and titties, and so this warped perception I'm forcing on young black women is, in fact, perfectly normal.\n\n> **Debra Lee, president and COO, BET Holdings, Inc.**  \nBET gets beat up for playing what is selling in stores and getting played in constant rotation on the radio. Many times the sexual aspect is gratuitous. You can&rsquo;t have women hardly dressed and men fully clothed and say it&rsquo;s not one-sided or problematic. It is an issue BET has to deal with. Years ago the concern was violence. Now it&rsquo;s sexuality, and some artists go too far. I hope this is a phase, and we do have to work with artists on it. But if more people are asking for it and like it, who&rsquo;s to say that&rsquo;s wrong? If artists put out videos like this, and people don&rsquo;t like it, they should vote at the record store. Our Uncut show enables us to offer the industry an outlet. If something is adult-oriented, we can say it is going to Uncut.\n\n**Translation:** Ass and titties sell, and as a for-profit company it is BET's responsibility to show as much gratuitous sexuality as possible. And if you don't like it, you should just stop buying it. (And by \"it,\" I do mean _all_ hip-hop except for that avant-garde \"art\" stuff only white people listen to.) In the interests of decorum, though, we do restrict the absolute _raunchiest_ stuff for a late-night program, and only subject primetime audiences to a lesser degree of raunch.\n\n> **Ludacris, hip-hop artist**  \nIn my videos I try to be versatile: Sometimes I have women dancing, and then, for example, in my Stand Up video, there are no naked women. I don&rsquo;t mean to depict women in a certain way. The ones who want to shake what their mama gave them are going to do that whether they&rsquo;re in videos or not. As artists, we explore our creativity through videos. Who sees those videos on BET, or whatever music channel is showing it, is not always up to us.\n\n**Translation:** I try to be versatile; sometimes there aren't _even_ naked women in my videos. Besides, it's not even me, it's the women's and BET's fault.\n\nTo be fair, some of the responses on _Essence_'s web site are thoughtful and to the point. Ironically, one of the more interesting ones came from the editor of _King_ magazine, which is best described as the hip-hop _Maxim_. In other words, this is a man who makes his living selling sex to young black people.\n\n> **Datwon Thomas, editor-in-chief of _King_ magazine**  \nIn the hip-hop industry, we get so competitive and do what will win and what will sell and go to any ends to make that happen. You get so caught up in competing that you may drop your guard and do something crazy. For example, if Smooth or Maxim has a hot girl that we featured or wanted to and they get her in a swimsuit, I think I want to show her topless in a thong. Or they photographed her with body paint, I have to put a vanilla wafer over her chest. I don&rsquo;t want to get locked into that. Eventually you&rsquo;ll have a butt-naked woman just standing there. I&rsquo;ve been able to not let it engulf me. I&rsquo;ve been a victim but haven&rsquo;t been engulfed. I have two daughters and a wife; I can&rsquo;t just give in to this.\n\nNow, I didn't say it was necessarily a _right_ viewpoint, but it is interesting that what Mr. Thomas is saying here is that he is torn between his own desire to shift away from this creeping anti-feminism, and his imperative as a highly paid magazine executive to promote it while out-raunching his competitors.\n\nThe mistake nearly all of the respondents make: accepting the connection between female sexuality and money as something that's normal, rather than the very essence of the problem. These people are saying that the reason why they can't depict women in a more positive light is because nobody's paying them to; that it can be in anyone's commercial interest to degrade black women is rather, well, _bad_.\n\nIn other words, _Essence_ and the hip-hop community have quite an uphill battle ahead of them, assuming they can even figure out what they're fighting for."

    body: "The Associated Press is reporting that [CNN has declined to offer Tucker Carlson a new contract,](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/ap/20050105/ap_en_tv/tv_carlson_crossfire) and with his departure may come the end of Carlson's long-running debate show _Crossfire_. New CNN chief executive Jonathan Klein was quoted as saying (quipping?) \"I guess I come down more firmly in the Jon Stewart camp.\"\r\n\r\nThe ever-modest Carlson, a conservative pundit for the network since the 2000 presidential election, wanted to move into a more prominent primetime role with such luminaries of respectable journalism as Paula Zahn and Aaron Brown. From the AP story:\r\n\r\n> [Carlson] subbed last week for newscaster Aaron Brown as Klein wanted to see him in a different role before making a decision about his future. Klein said his views on wanting to change the tone of political coverage were separate from the decision to keep Carlson.\r\n\r\n> \"His career aspirations and our programming needs just don't synch up,\" Klein said. \"He wants to host his own nighttime show and we don't see that in the cards here. Out of respect for him and his talent, we thought it would be best to let him explore opportunities elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### LiveJournal Purchased, Somewhat Legitimized\r\n\r\nFinally, in a move that will make LiveJournallers around the world react with a resounding \"who? what?\", [Six Apart, makers of Movable Type, have acquired LiveJournal.](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2005/01/current_mood_op.shtml) As explained by Six Apart president/lead singer Mena Trott:\r\n\r\n> I have great respect for LiveJournal. I wouldn't, as a board member, have approved this deal if I didn't think that this service, company and users were something special. Sure, I realize that there are communities that I can't understand or necessarily want to encourage, but I also know that there are many types of people out in the world and a great number of them aren't 27 year-old white women who work at weblogging companies. (...) The funny thing is, you can have a weblog and a LiveJournal. The fact that some of the funniest and smartest people I know have both only reaffirms that we shouldn't limit ourselves to one sort of publishing/communication mode.\r\n\r\nThe gist of what's happening is: Six Apart (who also own the hosted blogging service TypePad) now own LiveJournal. LiveJournal will continue to be a (mostly) free service, with higher paid levels of service/support. While the LiveJournal source code will continue to be open-source, Six Apart will be working to improve it to add such fabulous things as unified APIs and syndication formats (for improved interoperability between LJ and other blogging systems) and support for 6A's TrackBack reverse-linking technique.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is: this makes sense. Six Apart has been one of the big players in the blog space, but as weblogging/journalling goes mainstream it will become increasingly problematic that their competitors are Google and Microsoft, respectively. (It helps that Microsoft's product sucks and that Blogger's engineers are slower than molasses at making feature improvements.) The only thing that Blogger and MSN Spaces have to recommend them above a Six Apart product is that they're free and easy to use, while Six Apart has no software or service that is both of those things. Whereas LiveJournal is simple enough for beginners, free and has a pretty huge installed base of users.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this is a good thing."

That feature, called [TiVoToGo](http://www.tivo.com/4.9.19.asp), is <a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/dvrs/tivotogo-launches-028679.php\">finally here</a>.\n\nYet once again TiVo proves that they hate me: the TiVoToGo desktop software is Windows-only (for now) and there is no DVD burning (yet). Those bastards with their finite software development resources!!!\n\n[_Wired News_ has a preview piece up:](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66152,00.html)\n\n> TiVoToGo will be an automatic, free service upgrade for subscribers who own standalone Series2 TiVo DVRs. It will not work for subscribers owning DirecTV-TiVo satellite boxes. Also, the technology will work only with computers based on Microsoft's Windows XP or 2000 operating systems, although a version for Macintosh computers is planned, TiVo officials said.\n\nSigh. The reason I want TiVoToGo is that I want to be able to watch TiVo shows on the Mac in my bedroom. On older first-generation TiVos it was even possible to hack into the Linux environment on one's TiVo, install a streaming server and watch shows via QuickTime over a home network. Then they crippled the ability to do that once the movie studios and broadcast networks started whining, and it hasn't been the same since. _I want my TiVoToGo._"

    body: "So I awoke this morning hoping to re-read, improve and finish my epic-length _Year! In! Pictures!_ entry before I'm due at work, but, well, you see, back when I was a highly-paid and miserable web designer, before my own personal bubble burst, I bought a Logitech MX1000 laser mouse. A laser mouse is like an optical mouse, only a million times more powerful, a fact I remind myself of when I find that its extra shortcut buttons are impossible to configure the way I want them. Unlike the Microsoft mouse I got for Christmas last year, that I loaned to Lucy when I got the new Logitech one.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one of the cool features of this mouse is that it's rechargeable, with power-saving features that can keep it going for about two months on a single charge. I mention this now because I managed to go about two months without charging it, and this morning I am without mouse.\r\n\r\nYes, I have other mice. Yes, I even have this Wacom tablet that I'm using as my primary pointing device this morning. It is not the same. I am accustomed to reaching slightly up, slightly to the right, grabbing a disgustingly ergonomic cordless mouse and having my way with it. I am used to a scroll wheel. I don't care that my mouse takes 1-2 hours to charge. I want it now.\r\n\r\n**Regardless, the reason I'm coming to you now is _comments_.** I've spilled much ink (and blood-- er, red ink) over the issue of Movable Type comments and whether they should be enabled on this site.  You see, very few people have ever commented on this site, and I ended up removing the comments forms to deal with a spam issue.\r\n\r\nI do still feel, however, that offering a comment form is sort of the neighborly thing to do, and in the last two days I've seen a couple examples of interesting comment form designs that would be a huge improvement over what I had been using.\r\n\r\nThen again, I could just add an \"e-mail David\" link at the bottom of every post.\r\n\r\nSo I'm considering comments, working on new posts and even considering a site redesign just for kicks, since I introduced the \"torn paper/op-art colors\" aesthetic early last year and I'm due for a change.\r\n\r\n**Some of those posts I'm working on:**\r\n\r\n* Year! In! Pictures!!! _In which_ I take some random shit from my iPhoto library and spin a narrative of my 2004.\r\n\r\n* Macworld preview, for the Mac fans in the audience, where I report on some of the crazy rumors surrounding the coming product announcement in a vague, noncommital ways that still hopefully honors the spirit of my Apple corporate confidentiality agreement.\r\n\r\n* Music! I'm thinking of starting a feature called 'Media Consumption Tuesday,' where even if I'm not going out and buying stuff released that day I can at least talk about some of the media I've consumed lately. Like all the DVDs I bought for Christmas and Birthday.\r\n\r\n* An urgent plea: I will trade [Gmail](http://gmail.com/) invites for clean underwear. I have stipulations: underwear must be relatively trendy, from a reseller such as [H&M](http://hm.com) and the [Gap](http://gap.com/). In addition to a Gmail invite, I have other things to trade. But please. I am a lazy man who does not like to venture into his cold, dark basement to do laundry, and also a lazy man who can't plan enough time in his morning to stop by H&M or the Gap himself and buy fresh underpants.\r\n\r\n    Ideally I will trade one Gmail invite for one pair of boxer briefs. I will up the ante if necessary. The money is less the issue than the laziness. I need underpants.\r\n\r\n* By the way, _not one person_ wrote in to ask me for Gmail invites. Clearly it was not understood by some of you that those Gmail invites were _free_. Now I shall have to charge you. We take the following forms of payment: PayPal, gift cards to [Starbucks](http://starbucks.com/)/H&M/, underwear, [fresh prosciutto](http://fox-obel.com)."

Get this: there's a <em><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/31/6_stapler_doesnt_use.html\">\$6 stapler doesn't use staples!!!</a></em>\n\n<blockquote>Instead using the tiny pieces of metal that add up to lots waste, this ingenious little device joins your papers by punching a small, neat hole in your documents and folding the remaining flaps together for a secure binding.</blockquote>\n\nYeah, that's great, except that I'm way ahead of you: I have been using just such a stapler for _two years now._\n\nI first found one in a stationery shop on Rue Chartres on the French Quarter in New Orleans. See, I just sacrificed some pretention points by not referring to it as the \"Vieux Carr&eacute;,\" points I shall recover by mentioning that I bought my first Moleskine notebook on that trip and presently own at least six of them.\n\nAnyway, the  little thing is amazing. I used it on all my papers and stuff during _both_ my senior years of college, replacing the gold-plated Italian paperclips I had been using during my sophomore-junior \"rich bitch\" phase. A phase that you would think was ongoing given my predilection for handcrafted Norwegian walking shoes and amuse-bouches at trendy Chicago restaurants. You would be mistaken; I like those other things because they're awesome, not because I blow what right now would be an entire paycheck on them.\n\nBack to the staple-free stapler, here's a picture of mine:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/my_unstapler.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"281\" width=\"341\" alt=\"my_unstapler.jpg\" align=\"\" /></p>\n\nAnd here is what a staple-less staple looks like.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/unstaple.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"174\" width=\"200\" alt=\"unstaple.jpg\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" /></p>\n\nNot only have I used and enjoyed my staple-free stapler for a couple of years, I've taken to giving them as gifts. I recently gave one to my girlfriend Emily, and will make them an integral part of all token gifts I give in 2005.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2004/12/stapless_staple.php\">Link to Treehugger.</a> (Via <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/\">Boing Boing</a>.)\n\n**Update:** Sigh.

    body: "One thing I simply _love_ about bloggers is their charming tendency to make a misstatement, get called on it and then call everyone who disagrees with them assholes not necessarily because they disagreed, but because on their personal weblogs they are entitled to be wrong. In other words, one's blog does not exist in the reality-based community, where one should be troubled by anything like _facts._\r\n\r\nTake [this recent piece of oversimplifying bitchery](http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/006750.php) aimed at one of my favorite Mac application vendors, [Ranchero Software](http://ranchero.com/) (aka [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/)) and their latest product, the desktop blog editor MarsEdit:\r\n\r\n> Can anyone tell me why a software company, no matter the size, would require users to join a mailing list (that generates a ton of unwanted email and spam) to receive basic customer service? Doesn't that sound like a really, really bad idea? Remember when everyone was complaining about having to talk to someone in Asia to receive customer support? At this point I would love to talk to anyone, even in French if it meant I could get some assistance with MarsEdit.\r\n\r\n> (...Here our humble narrator describes his problem; deleted for irrelevance to the present discussion...)\r\n\r\n> Now I'm ok with software that doesn't work with just a few clicks because not everything is that simple. And I can appreciate the labor it takes to make software — mostly because I get punch-drunk-stupid when I have to look at anything beyond HTML — but I don't like the thought of having to join a mailing list to get support for software that I paid good money for.\r\n\r\n> That's like Maytag telling me I have to join a twelve step program to find out why the washer doesn't like colors mixed with whites.\r\n\r\nI bring attention to this, which seems on the surface like a perfectly reasonable gripe about a for-profit company's seemingly poor customer service, because it's factually wrong and because it's _Brent_. Ranchero doesn't require you to join anything to get support; it just so happens that the MarsEdit mailing list (on which, by the by, I have never seen a single piece of spam) is the fastest, best way to get accurate, effective support. There's a very passionate community of Mac users who are the sort of people who (virtually speaking) would, if you were pulled over with car trouble, stop and help you out.\r\n\r\nBut even if you don't want to use the mailing list, there is an option: e-mail the company. If we were talking about a consumer product from a corporate vendor, this would be a ludicrous suggestion (although I've had some really awesome e-mail support experiences from companies much larger than Ranchero). Brent almost always responds to e-mail within 24 hours, and these kinds of interactions not only make him a good guy to do business with but help him get valuable feedback to make products better.\r\n\r\nThis isn't PalmOne, a corporation with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, hiring some Indian teleservices firm to handle complex customer issues, or an ISP with millions of subscribers referring you to web-based support wizards. This is a tiny software company going above and beyond the call to support their customers through the most direct means available to them: your e-mail inbox.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Brent responded in the comments to that post with his support e-mail address and a way to send him the exact XML-RPC error so he could troubleshoot the blogger's MarsEdit error.\r\n\r\nAs far as the public record seems to show, while Brent has since added that e-mail address to the product pages for MarsEdit and NetNewsWire, the blogger in question has not recanted his statement that MarsEdit customers are required to join the mailing list to get support (which they are not), clarified that the mailing list is a discussion list rather than a one-way spam conduit or apologized to Brent.\r\n\r\nThe reason why such a correction is necessary is that small \"artisanal\" software vendors like Ranchero live or die by their reputations, and those reputations are formed by word of mouth, mostly on websites and (yes) weblogs. And in a world where people who use the word \"asshat\" on their website can be as credible as a New York Times technology columnist, these things matter."

    body: "I will note, first of all, that this is a story that ends (well, climaxes) at [L8](http://www.l8chicago.com/), which is next to (and owned by) Sound-Bar. Sound-Bar is a club, of the variety that seems endlessly cool to people with too much money and no capacity for danger. This small corridor of Ontario Street, blocks away from the shopping and family entertainment of the Mile, is where the hot boys and girls come to show off their clothes and the bodies that fill them, expressing for the universe their abject lack of imagination with regard to themselves.\n\nThese are the sort of establishments that offer a prefab image: the Hot Club with Cool Music where you spend Lots of Money trying to Pick Up Chicks. The capitals and implied scorn is not directed to the concept of coolness; it is my conviction that on this night, my companion and I were easily the coolest thing in the Near North. It is directed at the GapCrowd that looks at a place like Sound-Bar (as compared to the newer, trendier joints on Hubbard Street, or more underground stuff in Logan Square or even what used to be hip Wicker Park) and thinks, \"hey, this place makes me feel _cool.\"\n\nSo this is a story that comes to L8, which is absolutely not the only place in Chicago to offer steak and eggs and toast at three in the morning, but is possibly the only place to do so where the food is elegantly plated and served by waitstaff that look like henchmen from a James Bond movie.\n\nIt is also a story that includes no less than three cab rides, all tracing more or less the same route between downtown and my apartment near Wicker Park, a convenient bouncing back and forth that spared us cold but cost us \$30, and made certain aspects of the evening possible. To put the cab rides into perspective, the story must therefore include a harrowing passage detailing our hellish journey down Ontario with howling winds and freezing temperatures.\n\nFinally, this story must include certain truthful details of how these events came to pass (embellished in ways that make them more universal and entertaining to a mass audience; parentheses denote fiction):\n\n* The necessity of my caring for my friend's dear goldfish while she is in Ohio and the Dominican Republic (to become a drug mule smuggling heroin to finance an operation for her ailing brother, whose ass cancer has just spread from the left cheek to the right.)\n\n* The consumption of an entire bottle of cheap merlot, (leading to a situation where unpleasant truths are revealed, and not just about these characters and their relationship, mind you, but about the entire human experience. They may or may not inadvisedly have sex, which may or may not involve an infidelity, which may or may not get one of them pregnant, but may or may not be a huge deal because one of them may or may not be secretly afflicted with..._ass cancer._ [Tearful music.])\n\n* The viewing of a film at 1 A.M., which might be something like _Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events_, (but would, in fact, be some carefully chosen old movie -- or porn movie -- since everybody knows you just can't go see PG-rated new releases at one in the morning anywhere but New York and L.A.. And this story, this honest accounting, is _not_ set in New York or L.A.. Unless that would sell more tickets, in which case it most definitely occurred in a trendy section of Flatbush/West Hollywood yet was filmed in Toronto.)\n\n* Product placement, in the form of a Francis Coppola Sofia Mini can, which is a sparkling blush wine packaged in a tiny Red Bull can with a collapsible bendy straw. (Which could be accompanied by gratuitous iPod-flashing.)\n\nAs you see, the telling of this story is the sort of unvarnished journaling-slash-journalism you've come to (passively) demand from the weblog format."

    title: "Blockbuster: No More Late Fees"

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/blockbuster_logo.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"113\" width=\"180\" alt=\"blockbuster_logo.gif\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />Something this holiday season must have made [Blockbuster Video](http://www.blockbuster.com/)'s heart grow four sizes too big, as they've just announced that starting January 1, [they are abolishing late fees](http://money.cnn.com/2004/12/14/news/midcaps/blockbuster_latefees/) (or as they cutely refer to them, \"extended viewing fees\").\n\nThe move is part of Blockbuster's ongoing (uphill) battle to compete with [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/), the online rental service where there are no due dates, just a recurring monthly fee and limits on how many movies can be checked out at a time. The new plan does away with the daily late fee, and instead offers a one-week grace period after the due date for people to return items at no extra charge. After that, they're automatically billed for the price of the item minus the rental fee. And after _that_, they can still return the tape/DVD/game within 30 days minus a restocking fee.\n\nI tell you: the only reason I stopped using Blockbuster is because with all the late fees I was racking up by forgetting to return the 2-3 DVDs I rented in a given month, it became cheaper for me to just buy the things at Best Buy. Having an extra week to return stuff makes me a lot more likely to rent before I buy.\n\nIt helps also that I'm relatively broke."

    title: "My Knowledge of Sweden"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we are taken in by H&M and the promise of cheap things."
    body: "It was the first really shitty weather day of the winter in dear Chicago, and so it gave me my first opportunity to be taken in by the dear Swedes at H&M.  But first, I ventured to Nordstrom, where I have a small amount of credit, to buy socks. You see, the shitty weather (combined with, er, three days of heavy walking, standing and running at my place 'o work) conspired to make my socks soggy and gross. So I stopped at Nordstrom to buy athletic socks. I changed into a pair before leaving the mall, and that pair (I might add) was soggy and gross before I made it home. I was saved from an inexcusably rank messenger bag by that grand tradition of the men's underwear counter at a finer departmentstore, the Free Cologne Sample. So the now-destroyed pair of Emily's socks I was wearing at the time look of death, but smell of crisp, masculine death.\n\nNow, about the dear Swedes: THEY ARE RELENTLESS IN THEIR DESIRE TO SELL CHEAP THINGS. Earlier this year I learned what a sense-destroying, wallet-numbing experience IKEA can be, in its hugeness, its chaos and its...blueness. H&M is the same, except they sell clothes and are not so much blue. I saw an entire wall, my friends, full of nothing but boxer briefs in various bright colors and designs. I was lured in by the promise of cheap winter gear on a harsh winter's night. I bought gloves that were little more than crumpled Thinsulate&trade; insulation stuff packed into the shell of a cheap knit glove. I bought an acrylic scarf that will not survive the winter, but kept me warm on this one night. I passed many other items that I thought I wanted, but could not buy. Like pinstriped pants for \$42. Or t-shirts with faux retro styling.\n\nThe music is so danceatronic and hip that only when they played a Cure song did I not feel dated. The fashion shots on the walls of the men's department (maybe 400 square feet of a four-story NoMi behemoth) all feature the same hot Swedish guy, but in different clothes. I decided that the ad behind the registers was not, in fact, two pictures of the same man, but rather a picture of Jons and his identical twin brother Fritzi, both forced into male modeling at the young age of fourteen when their dear father, a scientist for Nokia researching whether that damned ringtone (Dadadada, dadadada, dadadada-DA) causes cancer, and their mother, who served Swedish meatballs in the restaurant at a Stockholm IKEA warehouse, were killed in a surprising moose attack.\n\nMy knowledge about Sweden is limited to the above, plus Ingmar Bergman."

    title: "Election Day"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Vote, you bastards!"
    body: "It's Election Day, not even noon, and I've heard a first-hand account of some good old fearmongering at the polls. At my friend James's polling place there was a longish wait to cast a ballot, and a rumor spread through the line that the delay was caused by police checking IDs at the front of the line. It turned out to be just overworked election judges, but there are a surprising lot of voters in this country who would hear \"police checking IDs\" and bolt.\n\nThere are certain people, and in the spirit of us all coming together to perpetuate our flawed, beautiful democratic system today I won't point a finger at any campaign in particular, who have an interest in seeing to it that certain other people don't vote. Over the past week the focus of the presidential campaigns has shifted from selling us on voting for their candidates, to selling us on voting or not voting at all.\n\nRegular readers of this site know my political beliefs lean towards strategically supporting John Kerry, so I won't try to hide that today I'm rooting for a Kerry victory (or more specifically, a Bush defeat.) There are encouraging signs for us. Despite all the efforts to prevent Americans from voting, people are committed to being heard: a record turnout is expected this Election Day, and high turnout almost always favors the Democratic candidate.\n\nAnd the latest data on the [Electoral Vote Predictor](http://www.electoral-vote.com/) website, which has been extrapolating the state-by-state tracking polls into a prediction of how many electoral votes each candidate will get, shows John Kerry winning with 296 EVs (270 are needed to win). In other words, Kerry could lose Ohio or Florida (but not both) and still become president. _Without_ a lawsuit.\n\nBut we're still a ways away from a finished campaign season here. Almost everyone I know is convinced that this election will drag on for months as both sides contest the other's claim to victory. I'm still hopeful that we will know the winner tonight, and that it won't be Bush. I'm prepared to be way wrong, but there's no way to know that until much later in the evening.\n\nSo we'll all watch and wait. My vote is in, and I urge anyone reading this in the U.S. who hasn't yet made it to the polls to please get off your ass and vote. Like, as soon as you can. Like now. Can you vote now? Why haven't you voted? Are you voting now? How about now? _Vote, you bastards!_\n\nAnd since I may not have another opportunity to say it: I am David Nemesis and I approved this message."

    title: "Political Roundup"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: " Why We Cannot Endorse President Bush For Re-Election: From The Tampa Tribune &rsaquo; The editors of a Florida newspaper that has endorsed the Republican candidate in every election since Eisenhower in &#8216;52 refuses to endorse either Bush or Kerry...."
    body: "* <a href=\"http://www.tampatrib.com/News/MGBU3UEHF0E.html\">Why We Cannot Endorse President Bush For Re-Election: From The Tampa Tribune</a> &rsaquo; The editors of a Florida newspaper that has endorsed the Republican candidate in every election since Eisenhower in '52 refuses to endorse either Bush or Kerry. They're skeptical of Kerry's ability to do the job, but disappointed by Bush's utter failure to live up to his campaign promises, not to mention his administration's botching of the war in Iraq.\n\n* Using the most current and empirically reliable polling data, [Slate has started predicting which way the electoral votes will fall](http://politics.slate.msn.com/id/2108392/) and there's good news for those of us on the left: if the election were held today, Kerry wins with 276 predicted electoral votes to Bush's 262. Not a landslide, but a far more decisive (possible) result than we had in 2000.\n\n    This is encouraging in part because in making this tally, Slate erred on the side of precedent and gave Colorado and Florida's votes -- expected to be the two most hotly-contested races -- to Bush, and assumed that all of Colorado's electorals are going to just one candidate. (Coloradoans are voting on a proposition to switch from a \"winner-take-all\" system to a \"proportional\" one simultaneously with the vote for a new President, so the assumption here is that voters there will reject the new measure and keep the status quo.)\n\n    This is smart because while nationwide poll numbers (e.g., the ones that have either candidate ahead by 1-2% with a 2-3% margin of error) make great headlines, they don't at all reflect the way a President is actually elected in this country. So by breaking it down by state, simulating the way the election will actually go down, Slate may have found the most effective indicator yet.\n\n    And it's encouraging because it takes Florida out of the equation and yet still manages to declare Kerry the winner.\n\n* I somewhat rarely agree with the weblog DonkeyRising, written by Democratic analyst Ruy Texieira (he's hypothetical and bullish about the Democrats' chances often past the point of reason), but today he has an [analysis of the Gallup poll's flawed methodology](http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000808.php) that's about as encouraging as Slate's electoral vote tally. Basically he argues that Gallup's profile of \"likely voters\" mistakenly washes out minorities and young people to an extent that isn't supported by historical data from, you know, actual elections.\n\n    So if the Gallup poll has Bush with an 8% lead over Kerry (with the typical ~2% margin for error) but fails to represent blacks, Hispanics, young voters and the poor (not specifically mentioned by Texieira, but also historically underrepresented in polling) and those groups get the vote out at levels equal to or even slightly lower than in 2000, that 8-point advantage deteriorates quickly."

    body: "Billionaire financier and outspoken Bush opponent George Soros (late of his war of words with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who [implied that Soros was a drug kingpin](http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/19796/)) has [just started his own blog](http://georgesoros.com/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Home).\n\n> Many people have written to me with questions about Kerry. Here is one such comment and my response.\n\n> Comment: You are wrong sir. John Kerry would make us much more vulnerable to terrorists. How can anyone with any sense support a candidate who continues to change his position on Iraq 36 days from the election. I won't, and I know most of my employees won't, and I know most of the people that I know who are small business owners won't either. The war on terror is the number one issue of this campaign.\n\n> My response: If you took the trouble to read my message, it may change your mind. You may come to realize that Bush has made us more vulnerable to terrorists than Kerry would. Calling Kerry a flip-flopper is a smear that has worked all too well. As Kerry himself pointed out in the first Presidential debate, \"Well, you know when I talked about the \$87 billion I made a mistake in how I talk about the war. But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is worse?\"\n\nSee, kids? Sometimes you _can_ be rich and powerful without being one of the bad guys."

    body: "<a href=\"http://www.anomalousdata.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8814d74d-5eb4-4f65-88a4-3efbf58e59f1\">Anomalous Data - \"It's OK. Don't think about it too much, and it will be OK\"</a>: \n\n> The teacher told of an exercise wherein he read from both the Bush and Kerry websites.&#160; He read where each of the candidates stood on the main issues of the campaign.&#160; He didn&rsquo;t say who was who&#8230;just &ldquo;this is what candidate one says, this is what candidate two says&rdquo;.\n\n> The kids made tally marks about each thing they agreed with from each candidate.\n\n> Then the kids voted on the issues.\n\n> Four kids voted for Bush.&#160;&#160;26 kids voted for Kerry.\n\nAnd this was in Eden Prairie, MN, which is a Bush/GOP stronghold. So kids and parents alike were understandably upset to learn that in a blind taste test, the other guy's soda pop tasted sweeter.\n\nIn other news from the state of Michigan, everyone's favorite rabble-rouser Michael Moore is [sick and tired of liberals who now say Kerry can't win.](http://michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-09-20)\n\n> Look at us -- what a bunch of crybabies. Bush gets a bounce after his convention and you would have thought the Germans had run through Poland again. The Bushies are coming, the Bushies are coming! Yes, they caught Kerry asleep on the Swift Boat thing. Yes, they found the frequency in Dan Rather and ran with it. Suddenly it's like, \"THE END IS NEAR! THE SKY IS FALLING!\"\n\n> No, it is not. If I hear one more person tell me how lousy a candidate Kerry is and how he can't win... Dammit, of COURSE he's a lousy candidate -- he's a Democrat, for heavens sake! ... Yes, OF COURSE any of us would have run a better, smarter, kick-ass campaign. Of course we would have smacked each and every one of those phony swifty boaty bastards down. But WE are not running for president -- Kerry is. So quit complaining and work with what we have.\n\nIt's a good sentiment...except that one of the things that makes the Republicans so much more powerful than the Democrats is their talent for turning innocuous comments by activists into signifiers of some reason why the opposition can't be trusted. \"Look at that!\" they'll say. \"Even Michael Moore says Kerry's a lousy candidate!\""
    extended: "Moore goes on to point out that the polls are wrong, that Kerry (unlike Gore) is accepting help from former President Clinton's political machine, that Iraq is an undeniably Vietnamesque disaster, that the TV is lying to you. The thing is that while all of these things are true, it may not matter, because highlighting the Democrats' opportunity to capitalize on Bush's biggest weaknesses assumes two things: that the Dems will in fact take the offensive in the six weeks left until the election, and that the Administration doesn't have a million other dirty tricks up its sleeve.\n\nEverything Moore lists is a suggestion that, yes, could have won the election for Kerry had his campaign been acting on it _months ago_. To be going over things like this _now_, at the end of September, is like when I have \$3 in my savings account but go into Excel and figure out how I could have three grand in there by the end of the year assuming that my income remains steady and I curtail my spending.\n\nThe Kerry campaign has failed to turn the disaffection for Bush into enthusiasm for Kerry, and the assumption all along has been that this was going to be another 2000 in the sense that the Democratic candidate would be waging an uphill war where the object is not to obtain a decisive victory, but to take it away from Bush. In other words, no matter what anyone says, the assumption has been that the 2004 election was Bush's to lose in spite of the fact that he's done everything he possibly could in the past four years to lose it.\n\nWhat Moore's saying is that we should lose our fear of Bush (and in the case of Democratic pundits and operators, our raging self-interest) and focus on the real-world, practical steps that can still be taken to topple him. But that fear is quite likely the reason why once again, the election is Bush's to lose.\n\nAnd the other anecdote, about the community of Bush supporters shocked to learn they supported Kerry over Bush in a blind test on the issues, is also telling about why Bush has the upper hand. The GOP is now, more than ever, a fiercely nationalistic party, and the booing in Michigan is emblematic of how strongly some people identify with the neocons for their pro-America, fuck-everyone-else worldview. Why, it's almost religious: the Democrats are telling us how the country should be run, but the Republicans are telling us _who we should be._\n\nThe Democrats would say (rightly) that it's none of our business whether Saddam Hussein is a murdering bastard who terrorizes his own people. For Bush and the neocons, demonizing him plays into Americans' belief in themselves as the most morally righteous, powerful good guys the world has ever seen. The Democrats would say that it is a tragedy that the rest of the world hates us, while the Republicans would say that the very attitudes that make the world hate us are what make us American.\n\nThe Democratic mistake is in forgetting to pay homage to the American mythology, and acting surprised when they find themselves on the losing side of a quasi-religious debate over our national character. Back in the day, do you think that an opposition candidate in the Roman republican state could win office while questioning all the things that made Rome glorious in the eyes of its citizens?\n\nThis line of thinking about our political system is depressing, for while Kerry would clearly win in a test of the issues, American nationalism isn't going away and the GOP will always have a greater talent for turning even petty policy debates into a religious argument."

    title: "Moblogging"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we talk about some shit."
    body: "Later this morning I'll update/re-post an entry from last night written and submitted from the line at the North Avenue Best Buy via my mobile phone. Is this \"moblogging?\" I posted a blog entry away from my computer, yes, but I'm having to revise it now with more text and photos as the tiny amount of information I can reasonably provide by tapping shit into my phone is hardly adequate to satisfy my gluttonous readership, and my own desires of being the most uselessly wordy site on the whole inter-web...thingy."
    extended: "For me and this site, the whole blog/moblog distinction (at least with regard to text) is silly. I currently write and edit Practicalmadness regularly from no less than two locations, and it is that ability to (e.g.) start a post at work, finish it at home and make the inevitable corrections to it wherever I am when I find them that appeals to me. That's the whole point of server-side publishing: the ability to add content is not reliant on my physical presence in any given place.\n\nSo if I can add a post from my phone, knowing that I will probably mark it up later with additional comments and photos, is that some other practice? Is that \"moblogging\" or just blogging? I say the latter; your mileage may vary.\n\n### Photologs\n\nI was going to mention some of this when I updated the piece on _Star Wars_ midnight madness, but while I'm on the subject let's talk about photologs, since a revamped photo thingy is going to be a major part of the big October 1 revision to this site.\n\nLast night I found myself posting photos via e-mail alternately to [Flickr](http://flickr.com/), [Yahoo! Photos](http://photos.yahoo.com/) and [My T-Mobile Pictures](http://tmobilepictures.com/). Each one had its drawbacks and advantages, which I may as well detail here.\n\n* **Flickr** - _Pros:_ Designed for sharing photos with friends, offering excellent ease of use, RSS/Atom feeds and collaborative features to that end. _Cons:_ But none of my friends post photos there, so it's still just one-way publishing with severe restrictions on storage and uploading.\n\n* **Yahoo! Photos** - _Pros:_ Desperate to lure in paying customers for its other services (like photo printing), Yahoo! offers unlimited photo storage and has just added for us phonecam users the ability to post photos by e-mail. _Cons:_ They send an SMS message confirming that new photos were posted, which is both annoying if I'm trying to take a bunch of shots quickly (as I have to click to dismiss the message) and costs me a nickel. I'm paying for unlimited picture messaging, and Yahoo's service is free, so this SMS thing (which as far as I know can't be turned off) bugs me on principle. Also: Yahoo's user interface blows.\n\n* **T-Mobile Pictures:** - _Pros:_ 25 MB of free storage to which I can post by either e-mail or by using a special three-digit phone number within T-Mobile's network. _Cons:_ Finite storage and (I think) a shitty user experience. The UI is better than Yahoo's, but nothing like the joy that is Flickr.\n\n\n### Tastes great, less filling\n\nNone of these services meets my needs. I want an online photo album -- not a moblog, because while there will be date-based organization the photos are not necessarily to be in sequential order. I want the unit of my photo album not to be a post with a photo on it. I want it to be, you know, _a photo_. I want an online equivalent to iPhoto that can easily be worked into the user experience of my site.\n\nThat the photos \"live\" on Practicalmadness is important: if I didn't think photos would enrich this site, I wouldn't be spending time writing and debugging PHP code to handle loading and saving images culled from an e-mail account, so I could post directly to the album from my phone.\n\nWhat should be the paradigm of the photos on the website? I've tried it two ways in the past. For Thousand Words everything lived in a MySQL table and was spat out to the browser dynamically via PHP scripts. And I had a JavaScript-driven filtering interface that let the album behave more like, yes, iPhoto. Over the summer, however, I developed Travelog, which was more of a traditional sideblog or moblog -- photos or short bursts of text.\n\nI need to poll the muses to find out which one was preferable for reading and enjoying, but I know that Thousand Words was tons easier to maintain because I got to avoid making decisions about where and how the images should be stored. In all honesty, I probably don't have enough traffic to worry about crashing a server just because a PHP script has to do some automated Photoshopping 25 times _per page_. But as I recall those pages load slowly, and besides: unnecessary scripting gives my hosting company heartburn.\n\n\n### A little apocalypse now and then\n\nIncidentally, if you've noticed that I'm referring a lot to Thousand Words and Travelog without linking to either, it's because I'm currently in the process of auditing my site files to see what exactly is taking up 82 MB of space on my server. I will be deleting some of those for the 10/1 revision. Permalinks _will_ be broken. Entire sections of Practicalmadness _will_ disappear. I will first review my server logs to see where I should consider offering redirects or apologies.\n\nThe hope is that you, Dear Reader, will notice none of this. Of what's loaded on the server, very little is visible to the public as I've boarded things up for one slipshod renovation after another. I'm not going to be removing any _content_, but I will be removing some of my PHP experiments, unused image files from past redesigns and generally working on optimizing the site for faster performance and easier maintenance.\n\nAnd the links currently used by Google and other search engines should still work, as I'm not changing anything about the way those are generated. For once, I'm happy with the aesthetics of my URLs. \n\nAnd while I'm at it, I've been reading [the Little Orange Book](http://zeldman.com/dwws/) and am toying with the idea of going back to total XHTML standardosity and even throwing in a little Section 508 compliance, as an exercise in building accessible websites.\n\nIf you don't know what any of this means (attn: muses), don't worry about it. (Unless you care to know, in which case you should come over to the Nemesisarium, have a glass of wine and let me bore you to death with talk of semantic purity and screen reading software.)"

It's full of a bunch of obscure symbols that are so open to interpretation, they could be applied to anything.\n\nI am not familiar with Christianity's return policy, but if they do accept returns or exchanges on their precepts, I _have_ always suspected that the whole dual nature of Christ thing was a manufacturing defect."

TPM was even my home page. I thought you an honest and truthful guy. Boy was I wrong.  \n\n> So how much are the dipshits paying you? Naturally I don't expect an answer. Even if you did reply you'd kill the golden goose.\n\n>> \"The word is out and about now that the CBS Bush National Guard memos are not forgeries but rather recreations of actual documents authored by Lt. Col. Killian.\n\n>> That theory gains credence from the fact that Killian's secretary has now said that though she believes these memos are not real that their contents reflect real documents that once existed in Killian's personal file -- ones she herself typed.\n\n>> There's a word, though, for these sorts of recreations, if that's what they are: forgeries.\"\n\n> Those grafs fail so many tests of integrity and journalistic ethics that I can only conclude they come straight from the WH or the RNC, not that it matters which.\n\n> You truly had me fooled Josh. I expect to see fulsome praise of the Pres in upcoming days for his valiant TANG service so all of us Americans can be as proud of him as he is and you are.\n\n> Steven B.\n\nI can totally see this guy's point, for in the current political climate willful denial of reality is de rigeur. If I say the sky is blue and other liberals are saying it's orange, clearly I'm betraying my fellows and taking bribes from the enemy. Marshall's acknowledgement of the Killian papers' shady origins couldn't possibly be based on mounting evidence that (regardless to whether the text of the memos reflects something Jerry Killian once said or wrote) the versions released by CBS most likely could not have been produced on that man's typewriter, in that squadron office, in that year. Nor could he be inspired by the fact that [even Dan Rather is acknowledging that there are 'serious questions'](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24633-2004Sep15.html?nav=rss_topnews) about the papers' veracity.\n\nNor did this 'Steven B.' seem to notice Marshall's series of posts yesterday poking fun at Bush's claim that he is proud to be [one of 19 Presidents to have served honorably in the National Guard.](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_09_12.php#003472) Clearly not, since he's expecting Josh to start spewing the Administration line about the President being so much more honorable in his service than that charlatan Kerry.\n\nI find myself thinking about Bush's line about being \"a uniter, not a divider,\" and also about a Marshall essay from last year, \"The Post-Modern President,\" in which he compares the Administration's use of vague, unverifiable assertions to justify major policy changes to wacky French theory.\n\nAnd it occurs to me that Bush may, in fact, be telling the truth by telling a lie. He is a divider, but he may be dividing us _so much_ that we will all in fact be united in our divisiveness.\n\nWhen liberal pundits can't even talk about facts as facts without filtering their words through ideology so that we can know if they're with us or against us, so that instead of focusing on ousting the government that's destroyed our country for the past four years we're calling each other traitors and Communists, it is apparent that the damage done to our political sanity may be permanent."

    body: "Let's see: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=581818&section=news\">a mysterious explosion occurs on North Korea's most important national holiday</a>, Sept. 9 (which was the day the North Korean Communist state was founded), involving a giant crater and 'a peculiar cloud.' Yet neither the South Korean nor U.S. governments believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.\n\n> President Bush and his top advisers have received intelligence reports in recent days describing a confusing series of actions by North Korea that some experts believe could indicate the country is preparing to conduct its first test explosion of a nuclear weapon, according to senior officials with access to the intelligence.\n\n> While the indications were viewed as serious enough to warrant a warning to the White House, American intelligence agencies appear divided about the significance of the new North Korean actions, much as they were about the evidence concerning Iraq's alleged weapons stockpiles.\n\n> Some analysts in agencies that were the most cautious about the Iraq findings have cautioned that they do not believe the activity detected in North Korea in the past three weeks is necessarily the harbinger of a test. A senior scientist who assesses nuclear intelligence says the new evidence \"is not conclusive,\" but is potentially worrisome.\n\nSome reports are now attributing the explosion to \"a dam-building project or some similar public work,\" and despite the American media's current fascination with spending hundreds of hours covering stories of no importance, I'd like to think that had North Korea tested a nuclear weapon for real the fearmongers in our government would be right there with the anti-Stalinist agitprop.\n\nBut the idea that it's even possible that a so-called \"rogue state\" with very public aspirations toward acquiring or developing WMDs could test a nuke, or even look like they might be testing one, without the US government going very publicly apeshit is extremely disconcerting.\n\n<p>(Via <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/12/mystery_explosion_in.html\">Boing Boing</a>.)</p>"

    body: "On Design Observer there's a thread about the [Jerry Killian memo font controversy](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/06/politics/main641481.shtml) (which has got to be the biggest thing in the typographic world since Clarendon Bold was made a corporate vice president at Starbucks), where such luminaries of letterpress as Jonathan Hoefler and Matthew Carter (who designed Verdana and Georgia for Microsoft, as well as commissioned faces for MoMA, The New York Times and Yale University) have come to the following stunning conclusion: _we don't fucking know whether the memos are forged, okay?_\n\nThe memos in question, which support the theory that Pres. Bush skipped out on his National Guard service (which was itself intended to let him skip out on going to Vietnam) to get drunk, do drugs and other activities that have since been covered up by his family and his administration, were released by CBS following an in-depth _60 Minutes_ report on the matter. Col. Jerry Killian was Bush's supervising officer in Texas, who writes about receiving pressure from higher-ups to give the young Dubya good marks on performance reviews so as to speed his transfer to a non-training unit in Alabama.\n\nThe memos, which were \"to file\" and essentially notes to himself, are set in what appears to be Times New Roman, with some typographic effects (a superscripted \"th\", so-called 'smart' quotes) that (it is argued) were not possible using the sort of typewriter or word processor technology available to an Air Force colonel in the early 70s. The implication is that the memos are bad fakes by someone who thought they could mock something up in Microsoft Word and get away with it.\n\nThe prominent typographers on the Observer thread, who are experts on those sorts of effects, their proper use and design, nonetheless are not familiar enough with the technology and whether it happened to be in use in a particular National Guard office by a particular colonel at a particular time to be of any help in solving the mystery. Other than to say that yes, it is awfully peculiar.\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000198.html\">Font Forensics, Or Whether George W.

    body: "<img src=\"http://img.slate.msn.com/media/97/040825_Kerry_dailyshow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"165\" height=\"200\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\">I just caught [John Kerry's](http://johnkerry.com/) Tuesday night appearance on _The Daily Show_ on my TiVo yesterday, and while I'm still not super-enthused about his candidacy I didn't come away half as disappointed as [Slate](http://slate.msn.com/) columnist Dana Stevens who slammed the Democratic senator from Massachusetts [for not being entertaining enough](http://slate.msn.com/id/2105618).\n\n> Kerry seemed unclear on the concept that he was there precisely to poke fun at the recirculated sound bites of the talking-head circuit...All he had to do was shoulder his rocket launcher...and take aim at the received wisdom that has kept the focus of this campaign exactly where the Bush camp wants it to be: on who did what in a war we lost 30 years ago, rather than what to do next in the war we're losing right now.\n\n> Instead, Kerry ignored every opening Stewart gave him, preferring to dust off rhetoric that's become familiar even to casual followers of his campaign: \"You don't go to war because you want to. You go to war because you have to.\" That was a good line at the convention, but baby, the convention was a month ago! This is Jon Stewart, the king of politically savvy late-night television. You need new A-list material. Get someone on it.\n\nJohn Kerry is a serious man who (unlike the man he's looking to replace) is not prone to glibness or inclined to crack jokes when there are serious issues to discuss. The idea that politics is show-business, that the electorate needs to be entertained to keep them engaged, is hopelessly cynical and plays right into the Republican style of campaigning-as-character assassination.\n\nI'm not so na&iuml;ve or idealistic as to think that Americans are yet capable of having an _actual dialogue_ about the issues, but to expect that John Kerry show up on Jon Stewart's program and suddenly be as electrifying a personality as Bill Clinton is just stupid. It's like what Stevens is saying here is that she doesn't care who the candidate is, she's just looking for media savvy. That's not Kerry at all. John Kerry has gravitas, war hero cred and a lifetime of public service under his belt, but he'll never be John Kennedy or even Bill Clinton. And that's okay.\n\nOne thing that definitely may have tripped Kerry up, which trips up many of Stewart's guests, is that since _The Daily Show_ lives in a bizarre nether-realm between legitimate journalism, satiric comedy and late-night talk, how do you present yourself? Are you part of the show, all entertainment? Or do you talk about issues and risk looking like a total tool?\n\nIf you don't have cable, didn't manage to catch any of the million _Daily Show_ repeats yesterday or didn't tape or TiVo it, then one of two things must be true:\n\n1. You're a Republican spy, fascist!\n2. You might be interested in viewing [this QuickTime version of Jon Stewart's interview with Mr. Kerry](http://waxy.org/random/video/Daily_Show_-_John_Kerry_Interview.mov) on Waxy.org.

In fact, I'm meeting her for lunch tomorrow. We're eating Chinese food.\n* <b>Anger:</b> Fuckers! I'll kill the fucking bastards who killed her! Where are they!\n* <b>Bargaining:</b> I'll sell everything I own and join a Mormon death cult...I'll help the poor...anything if it will bring Lucy back.\n* <b>Depression:</b> Without Lucy, there is no point to living. I will now spend my days staring into the middle distance, alternately watching _Springer_ at home and pretending I'm working at the office.\n* <b>Acceptance:</b> Lucy's gone. Which sucks.\n\nIn later years, having successfully deconstructed death, Kubler-Ross went even further into the unknown.\n\n> Her fame already established, [she] began a spiritual journey which convinced her of the existence of post death survival of the human soul. The result of collecting over 20,000 reports of near-death experiences (NDEs), including those of children. Many of her former supporters looked askance at this shift in her world view (especially her belief in spirit guides, or \"spooks\" as she called them). But she considered it logical and consistent with documentary evidence obtained from the dying and the near dead. ([Plastic](http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=04/08/26/03395650))\n\nFor broadening our understanding of the way we deal with death, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross will live on in our hearts. And in that sense, isn't actually dead. In fact, I'm having lunch with her tomorrow."

    body: "Josh Marshall's [Talking Points Memo](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_08_08.php#003261) has been giving great coverage of the recent announcement of former GOP presidential candidate Alan Keyes as Barack Obama's opponent for Illinois's vacant Senate seat.\n\n> If anyone thought that Alan Keyes was going to start marching around Illinois spouting clownish bombast and giving Barack Obama a chance to play the statesman in the face of the Illinois GOP's cynical nonsense, boy do they have another thing coming.\n\n> Today Keyes attacked Obama for taking the \"slaveholder's position\" by voting against a ban on late-term abortion which had no exception for protecting the life of the mother.\n\n> \"I would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence,\" Keyes said. Obama, he said, \"has broken and rejected those principles -- he has taken the slaveholder's position.\"\n\n> When asked about the \"slaveholder\" comment, Obama told the AP that Keyes \"should look to members of his own party to see if that's appropriate if he's going to use that kind of language.\"\n\nFor our non-Illinois readers who aren't closely following a Senate race in another state, this campaign is the first time that both major party candidates for the Senate have been African-American. Keyes was offered the spot on the ticket not only because his blackness might somehow mitigate for black voters the fact that he's a pompous ass, but because of his reputation as \"a master debater.\" So maybe Keyes'll get in a few good shots before he is totally steamrollered by Obama, a rising Democratic star whose natural talent for working a crowd into a lather is being compared to Bill Clinton's."

    description: "If there's a lobbyist out there representing the baby-killing industry, and Congress tries to enact legislation that is detrimental to the baby-killing industry, then you had better believe that somewhere, someone would be writing an editorial that goes something like this."
    body: "<img src=\"/m/images/valenti.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Hopkins is...VALENTI(!!!)\" width=\"200\" height=\"280\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\">MPAA President Jack Valenti, Hollywood's designated lobbyist in Washington for nearly four decades, is retiring, and over at Lawrence Lessig's weblog, Tim Wu has posted [a fantastic list of some of the most memorable Valentisms](http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002065.shtml#002065) from that long, long, <i>long</i> career.\n\n> On the nascent cable industry, in 1974  \n\"[Cable will become] a huge parasite in the marketplace, feeding and fattening itself off of local television stations and copyright owners of copyrighted material. We do not like it because we think it wrong and unfair.\"\n\n> On the public domain, 1995  \n\"A public domain work is an orphan. No one is responsible for its life. But everyone exploits its use, until that time certain when it becomes soiled and haggard, barren of its previous virtues. How does the consumer benefit from the steady decline of a film's quality?\"\n\n> On the meaning of Copyright, 1983  \n\"[We face a threat to] the life-sustaining protection, I guess you would call it, on which copyright owners depend, on which film people depend, on which television people depend and it is called copyright.\"\n\n> On the meaning of value, 1983  \n\"Nothing of value is free. It is very easy ... to convince people that it is in their best interest to give away somebody else's property for nothing, but even the most guileless among us know that this is a cave of illusion where commonsense is lured and then quietly strangled.\"\n\nIf you're noticing a pattern here, it should not surprise you to hear that this is how Washington lobbyists work, and Valenti has been a supremely effective lobbyist. If there's a lobbyist out there representing the baby-killing industry, and Congress tries to enact legislation that is detrimental to the baby-killing industry, then you had better believe that somewhere, someone would be writing an editorial that goes something like this:\n\n> On baby-killing, 2004  \n\"It is very easy to convince people, perhaps by using television commercials with soft-focus cinematography and sentimental music, that it is somehow <i>im</i>moral to kill babies for profit. But we here know better that this is a skanky-looking van or large sedan of illusion where commonsense is lured with candy and then violated, violated some more, strangled to death, and then violated some more. And we as Americans cannot allow that! We must push this legislation forward!\"\n\nTwo things, briefly, about this preview of the poster for the Jack Valenti biopic, <i>Valenti</i>, slated to hit theaters in 2008:\n\n1. It's not real. And even if it were real, I'm sorry, but Anthony Hopkins will never be as sexy and dramatically lit as Jack Valenti himself.\n\n2. I unfortunately have to, like, make pictures smaller(?) to fit them on this web site? And so you'll be unable to read the rating at the bottom of the poster. Parents will be pleased to know that <i>Valenti</i> is rated RS (Really Stupid), which means that there is no sexy stuff but plenty of disturbing violence involving chainsaws and babies, and lots of strong language about intellectual property. No one under 7 admitted without a tub of popcorn and nachos from the concession stand. Three drink minimum."

    body: "<img src=\"/m/images/michaelmoore.jpg\" width=\"203\" height=\"152\" alt=\"&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; director Michael Moore\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\">The New York Times is reporting that [Arabs are Riveted And Angered By <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>.](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/movies/04cair.html). And yet, some critics are cautioning audiences not to be so enthusiastic about Michael Moore's spirited critique of the Bush II Administration, since it presents a less than positive image of \"the region and its people.\" Which, as far as I can tell, is a really interesting euphemism for Saudi Arabia and the Saudi royal family.\n\n> Mamoun Fandy, an expert on Saudi Arabia based in Washington, wrote an op-ed article in Asharq Al Awsat, the Arabic newspaper in London, blasting the movie as racist and making faulty generalizations about Arabs, who, he argued, should not hail it as supporting their cause. [Kuwait barred the movie as offensive to its Saudi neighbors](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3527000.stm), and the Saudi ambassador to London, Prince Turki al-Faisal, was quoted in the London-based Arabic daily daily Al Hayat as saying the movie twisted the truth and was inadequately researched.\n\nI'm having trouble understanding why tracing a connection between the Bush and Saud families is so insulting. I mean, Moore has exhaustively proven that Saudi Arabia is the one Middle Eastern nation that can host American military bases _and_ (allegedly) fund and harbor the terrorists coming after American civilians because of those military bases, and still never have to face down U.S. smart bomb attacks. If I were the Saudi royal family, I'd be like, \"sweet!\"\n\nMaybe they're just upset because \"Bandar Bush\" is the stupidest name ever.\n\n[Moore's exhaustive list of sources](http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/) for his apparently inadequate research can be found on his web site."

    body: "<img src=\"/m/images/lay_20040708.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"184\" height=\"219\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />Kenneth Lay, former chairman/CEO of Enron, [surrendered to the FBI this morning](http://nytimes.com/2004/07/08/business/08CND-LAY.html?hp) and is expected to face indictment in a federal courtroom in Houston later today. Lay still maintains that he has done nothing wrong, and was part of [the 98% of Enron staff who were honest, hardworking Americans](/m/2004/07/the_two_percent_solution).\r\n\r\n> In charging Mr. Lay, the Justice Department's Enron Task Force has reached the top of the corporate hierarchy at the company, which has been under broad investigation since it was forced into bankruptcy in December 2001, costing investors tens of billions of dollars and putting thousands of employees out of work. So far, criminal charges have been filed against some 30 people, including former executives and advisers who have been charged with aiding Enron in its deceit.\r\n\r\n#### Life in a glass house\r\n\r\nThe vast right-wing conspiracy by Republican's looking to make total asses of themselves by trying to make themselves look better than John Edwards has begun. At a campaign stop in Edwards's home state of North Carolina, W. was asked to compare his own running mate, <del>President of Vice</del> Vice President Dick Cheney, with Mr. Edwards. His response was characteristically short and...well, it was characteristic: [\"Dick Cheney can be president.\"](http://nytimes.com/2004/07/08/politics/campaign/08govern.html?hp)\r\n\r\nWait, was that an invitation? A concession? An order? Of course, what W. is trying to say here is that since Dick Cheney can be president, John Edwards cannot. Which may be a valid point: Cheney's old and corrupt, Edwards is young and (at worst) far less corrupt. From the GOP way of thinking, Edwards needs to be a few decades older and have ruined many, many more lives to be remotely qualified to hold public office in this country.\r\n\r\n#### Nigritude ultramawhat?\r\n\r\nBlogger [Anil Dash](http://dashes.com/anil/) has [won a search engine optimisation contest](http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,64130,00.html), where websites were challenged to use any means at their disposal -- from link/keyword spamming to, like, generating actual content -- to get the highest Google ranking for the terms [\"nigritude ultramarine.\"](http://www.google.com/search?q=nigritude+ultramarine&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) Dash's innovative solution? Asking his readers to link back to him using those words.\r\n\r\n> Dash maintained, his victory proves...that the Web is a meritocracy. \"A page that's read by people instead of robots is going to do better,\" he said."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/_40322177_lay203b.jpg\" height=\"152\" width=\"203\" alt=\"_40322177_lay203b\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em\" />The BBC reports that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3875297.stm\">former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is finally due to face indictment in a Houston courtroom tomorrow morning.</a>\n\n> Details of the charges against him are contained in sealed indictments and will not be disclosed until then. Prosecutors have been trying to build a case against Mr Lay for over two years and his indictment had been expected.\n\n> In June, Mr Lay blamed the fraud on his finance chief, saying he was one of the 98% of Enron staff who were \"good, honest, hardworking individuals\".\n\nThis statement by Lay strikes me, because according to this other BBC article reporting on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3773547.stm\">the now medium-sized firm's possible reemergence from Chapter 11 protection</a> this summer, Enron once had 39,000 employees.\n\nDoes Lay mean to imply that literally two percent of Enron's staff -- 780 individuals who are _not_ named Kenneth Lay -- are, perhaps..._evil?_ Or perhaps that 780 individuals, all with management responsibilities, the ability to restructure the company and its partnerships and access to Enron's financial records, were embroiled in a massive conspiracy to hide growing debts from the feds, and that he didn't once suspect that any of these 780 co-workers might be up to something?\n\nI'd be interested to know how many of the 39,000 workers employed by Enron in 2001 were based out of the company's Houston headquarters. While I suspect that it may be more than 780, I also suspect that 780 people would constitute a vast majority of the workforce there.\n\nSo not only did these nefarious people conspire to defraud Enron's investors and evade prosecution, but they could have tampered with the voting for the name of the new corporate newsletter! (Which might also explain how \"We Didn't Do It, You Can't Prove Anything\" became a surprise front-runner in that contest.)\n\nThe moral of _this_ story, at least, is that \"98%\" does not mean the same as \"pretty much everybody\" when your company has 39,000 people on staff."

But I will not do so as a mailing list. Mailing lists are so...'90s. I will bring it back as a weekly posting to the personal ads on Craigslist.\n\nHow did I get this crazed idea? From posting [a personals ad on Craigslist.](http://chicago.craigslist.org/m4w/35203669.html) Of course, I did so only after I had the idea of posting the most surreal, lengthiest, most Demareesque ad ever, where I managed to name-check Peet's and _Eternal Sunshine_, and reference _Seven Samurai_ and _Knight Rider_. People keep telling me to be myself, so I decided to be myself: arrogant, sarcastic, curmudgeonly and fearfully iconoclastic. Usually, when I do this, I make friends. Truth in advertising, baby. Consider it the trailer for the epic black comedy sci-fi melodrama that is me.\n\nFailing all else, I'm thinking of jumping into the social networking craze by opening a new site called Demareester, which will be the Ford Model T of friendster-like sites: you can make any friend you want, so long as it's me.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1em 0\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/Demareester.png\" height=\"420\" width=\"396\" alt=\"Demareester\" /></div>\n\nAnd now for something completely different: [Le Cornichon.](/images/angry_pickle.jpg)"

    body: "<!-- <img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/travelog/images/gmail_20040628.png\" height=\"148\" width=\"185\" alt=\"gmail_20040628\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1em\" /> -->\n\nI've had <a href=\"http://gmail.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to Gmail\">Gmail</a> since Wednesday evening, and the best compliment I can give to Google's new approach to storing, indexing and browsing one's e-mail messages is that I am now totally keeping up with my mailing lists.\n\nI'm beta testing <a href=\"http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/\" target=\"_blank\">NetNewsWire 2.0</a> and subscribe to the beta discussion list, and so far I've used Apple Mail's threading feature to try to manage the influx of information. Obviously it wasn't working very well, since I all but stopped reading the beta list, instead just skimming the message titles to see if <a href=\"http://www.inessential.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brent</a> had released a new build and deleting the rest.\n\nMail and Gmail take a similar approach to the same problem, condensing message threads into what Gmail calls \"conversations\" and displaying a single conversation as a single header, which can then be clicked on and expanded to see the messages that comprise it. So when Brent posts about a planned new feature, and a dozen people reply to that post to offer criticism/suggestions/toadying, it's really easy in Gmail to read what everyone has said so that I feel more comfortable -- this is the key thing, people -- _joining in the conversation myself._\n\nMail does the same thing, grouping related messages together, but it still handles each message as its own separate item, so that reading through a whole thread involves a lot of clicking. And while Mail is a wonderful desktop mail client, It will never be as fast at storing, indexing and retrieving information as the Google server farm.\n\nAlso, while the JavaScript/DHTML-laden user interface for Gmail gives a whole new level of meaning to the term \"buggy,\" the scripting has solved many of the disadvantages to using a web-based e-mail client rather than a traditional desktop app. It even has autocompletion for the address fields[1], which is amazing."
    extended: "fn1. Where you start typing a name or e-mail address and the software uses your contact list to fill in the most likely name or names, saving you and your fingers some time. Web-based e-mail clients like Gmail have never had this feature before. I suspect that this has less to do with technology than with ingenuity -- Google's innovation here is not in making one's browser do the impossible, but in doing something really difficult and having it work regardless of which platform or browser you're using."

    title: "The Stepford bus"

    description: "But she works for the city! It's not normal!!!"
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/sheridan_bus_20040628.jpg\" height=\"226\" width=\"292\" alt=\"sheridan_bus_20040628\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1em 1em\" />I had what is possibly the strangest [CTA](http://www.transitchicago.com/] commute in the history of, well, this week's CTA commutes. When the doors opened, I noticed that the farebox had one of those \"DEFECTIVE FAREBOX\" stickers covering the [Chicago Card](http://chicago-card.com/) touchpad, indicating that all I need to do to board is to flash my card since there's no way to charge me for the ride. So I do so with the well-practiced, offhand ID-flashing gesture perfected over five years getting into and out of SAIC buildings, and do so without looking up or missing a step to the closest empty seat.\n\nThen, over the bus PA system, the bus driver (a middle-aged black woman) said\n\n> Attention, customers! Remember that when the Chicago Card touchpad is out of order you can just show your Chicago Card to the operator. There is no need to be rude to the operator while doing so. Thank you. This is Leavitt.\n\nWhat did I do?? I'm the only one who didn't find themselves stuck fumbling for change or a Transit Card at the front of the bus, so she's obviously talking to me. Was I supposed to stop, show her my card, smile and thank her for being such a conscientious (and beautiful and charming) bus driver when it's 8:05, the bus is several minutes late and I'm worried about making it to my job? And why did she need to say that it's Leavitt? The robot voice does that.\n\nRegardless, while my bubble of self-importance was momentarily burst, that was the only unusual thing...until we hit Hoyne and she came over the speaker again to announce the stop. Again, there is no reason for her to do so, since the CTA has installed its now-familiar Robot Voice to announce stops on bus lines. For example, when the bus detects that it's at Damen Avenue (using some combination of GPS satellites and evil powers), the Robot Voice announces:\n\n> Damen!\n\nAnd when it gets to Milwaukee, where one can transfer to a Blue Line train, it announces:\n\n> Milwaukee! Transfer! To! Blue Line!\n\nAnd so it is extremely unusual for a CTA bus operator to come over the PA every few seconds to announce (e.g.):\n\n> This is Damen Avenue. Transfer here for the #50 Damen bus.\n\nYes, it's really nice and helpful. Yes, it's great that a bus driver goes above and beyond the call of duty to tell people when to transfer to major bus lines like Damen or Halsted. _But she works for the city!_ It's not _normal!!!_\n\nOf course, in terms of commuting strangeness, nothing quite tops or even matches the time an old man at the back of the bus was chanting something about anally raping the Virgin Mary all the way from Fullerton Avenue to the Loop. But for the purposes of this morning, it was surreal enough."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/smiles_20040625.jpg\" height=\"190\" width=\"270\" alt=\"20040625_smiles\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1.0em 1.0em; border: 1px solid #999\" />You heard it from the _New York Times Magazine_: [happiness is for crazy people.](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/magazine/20WWLN.html) [Free registration required.]\n\n> There is one bit of the world that happy people do see in an irrationally rosy light: themselves. As the British psychologist Richard P. Bentall has observed, ''There is consistent evidence that happy people overestimate their control over environmental events (often to the point of perceiving completely random events as subject to their will), give unrealistically positive evaluations of their own achievements, believe that others share their unrealistic opinions about themselves and show a general lack of evenhandedness when comparing themselves to others.'' Indeed, Bentall has proposed that happiness be classified as a psychiatric disorder.\n\nSee! See! It's like I've been saying! Happy, well-adjusted people? _THEY'RE CRAZY!!!_\n\nReporter Jim Holt goes on to cite statistics showing that women and minorities, who have made the most progress in the areas of life, liberty and pursuit of a paycheck over the last 50 years, are reporting a decline in overall happiness. Furthermore, studies show that people can be genetically predisposed to be happy, that marriage (but _not_ parenthood) can foster it, that money has nothing to do with it and that generally, religious people are happy, but more from the social support of being part of the church rather than the whole God thing.\n\nThe common element here, of course, is interpersonal connections: having good relationships and common bonds makes one happy. If you're in the group, you're happy. If you're not in the group, you're a loser. See, it's like they've been saying since high school -- if you're not one of Us, you suck. So what you really need is to be one of Us. But you're like not nearly cool enough to be one of Us, so you can go and like die.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/rem_20040625.jpg\" height=\"195\" width=\"400\" alt=\"20040625_sesamestreet\" /></p>\n\nDrink yer [Kool-Aid.](http://www.gbs.sha.bw.schule.de/jim_jones_history.htm)"

    body: "From [_21 Rules of Thumb: How Microsoft Develops Its Software_](http://blogs.msdn.com/David_Gristwood/archive/2004/06/24/164849.aspx):\n\n> It is essential not to profess to know, or seem to know, or accept that someone else knows, that which is unknown. Almost without exception, the things that end up coming back to haunt you are things you pretended to understand but didn&#8217;t early on. At virtually every stage of even the most successful software projects, there are large numbers of very important things that are unknown. <strong>It is acceptable, even mandatory, to clearly articulate your ignorance, so that no one misunderstands the corporate state of unknowingness.</strong> [Bolds mine - ed.] If you do not disseminate this \"lucid ignorance,\" disaster will surely befall you.\n\nSpecifically the author is referring to the process of software development, but is there anything in modern life for which it would not be a good idea to articulate one's ignorance, so that no one misunderstands the general state of unknowingness?\n\nObviously our government lives by this rule, and the electoral process: had certain Florida voters articulated their ignorance _prior_ to casting their votes back in 2000, would we now not misunderstand the location of the Iraqi WMDs? It's, like, that thing where a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo and a building falls over in Bahrain or something -- we're all connected in our state of unknowingness, like, and um, yeah. \n\nNobody knows anything.

Not because I'm a closet Republican, but rather because there were _so_ many Tom Clancy jokes to be made.\n\nThen I got busy, and got bored, and really, none of those jokes were any good, since nobody cares about the Senate in Illinois except people who, unlike myself, care that they live there. But now I'm wishing and hoping I kept it, because it has just been promoted from really stupid campaign relic to really stupid C-list pop culture relic.\n\nBut wait! There is even more irony to be had here!\n\n> On June 21st, Ryan found himself campaigning in downstate Mt. Vernon, where the Republican nominee lashed out at his opponent, characterizing [Democratic candidate Barack Obama] as being \"out of the mainstream of Illinois values\" (even though Ryan's campaign has already copped to having Obama stalked.)\n\n\"Out of the mainstream of Illinois values\" is a euphemism here for \"intelligent black man,\" which I guess makes sense to a man for whom \"romantic getaway\" means \"have sex with me on a dirty mattress while other people watch.\"\n\nStill, there is a bittersweet aspect to all of this: with Ryan's prospects pretty much flamed, Bizarro World, IL may never again put forth another of its citizens to represent this great state in the U.S. Senate. Won't someone _please_ think about the Bizarro World???\n\nSee also: [Young Republicans A Big Part Of Team Jack](http://www.jackryan2004.com/photos/photoview.asp?p=276)"

The study found that 49 nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare specialists were discharged, as well as 90 nuclear power engineers and 150 rocket and missile specialists.\n\n> Eighty-eight linguists were discharged, including at least seven Arab language specialists.\n\nJust to clarify to those Americans who may have been assuming that 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' discharges were all confused 19-year-old gay men who you didn't want hanging around your own not-confused, definitely <em>not</em> gay 19-year-old killing machine. These discharges may actually, like, hurt the US's capability for carrying out peacekeeping missions, intelligence and covert ops in the war on terror, nuclear weapons control and basically anything that does not involve killing brown people and making brown people want to kill us.\n\nTo recap, gays in the military <strong>are</strong>: Interrogators, nuclear weapons specialists, soldiers, spies and people you want hanging around if there's ever a sarin gas attack.\n\nGays in the military <strong>are not</strong>: wearing pink camouflage. At least hopefully not in the workplace. There is a time and place to be fabulous, and while disarming a nuke or questioning an al-Qaeda member is (usually) not it."

    body: "<img src=\"/m/images/mabuse.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px\" />I've been spending too many hours (most of them while sleeping) tuned to <em>Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse</em>, the Fritz Lang film where the rise of Nazism was used as an excuse to resurrect not one but <em>two</em> of Lang's favorite characters: the supercriminal Mabuse (pictured), and Lohmann, the portly, cigar-chomping superdetective from <em>M</em>.\n\nClearly, out of sheer boredom, this character _needed_ to be pitted against the nefarious Dr. Mabuse (pronounced Ma-BOO-sa), who apparently has super-powers and can plot attacks on Depression-era Germany's already shaky financial system from beyond the grave.\n\nI've lost count of how many times something like this happens in the movie:\n\n> LOHMANN: Hallo! Ist Lohmann!\n\n> BAD GUY: Lohmann??\n\n> LOHMANN: Ja, ist Lohmann!\n\n> BAD GUY: LOHMANN!! MEIN GOTT!!! AAAAAAAGGHHH!!!\n\nThe disc is <a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=231\">Criterion's new edition</a>, with a psychedelic cover and an excellent commentary by David Kalat, who wrote a book on Lang's Mabuse cycle and who sounds really authoritative on a commentary track.\n\nLike the SAIC teacher who first turned me onto the film, Kalat focuses primarily on Lang's use of sound and editing, while adding in the historical facts about the rise of Nazism, and some historical lies about Lang having been approached by Goebbels to head the German film industry.\n\nIf anything, it's worth the price of admission to see Lohmann say\n\n> If I'm on the right track...I'm gonna get high as a kite tonight!\n\nwhile pounding his fists on the table in excitement."

Now that the purchase has been accomplished, I can tap my wallet to the farebox on the aforementioned #70 bus to get back to Wicker Park.\r\n\r\nMy workplace triumphs for the week include designing a very manly website for a company run by firemen."

    body: "Phil Ringnalda \"dissects the Movable Type 3.0 licensing terms\":http://philringnalda.com/blog/2004/05/licensing_matters.php in a blog entry/comment thread that quickly devolves into an argument between \"Shelley Powers\":http://weblog.burningbird.net/ and Everyone Else.\n\n> I also don't think that Six Apart is trying to 'screw' their users...this is just Six Apart redefining the type of user they want now. So those of us who don't fit in this definition move on. Some of us saw the writing early, and moved on early. Others didn't and reacted, yet even with anger, because frankly, they weren't expecting to have to face a decision about whether they were going to continue using MT 3.0 when it came out. And yes, this makes software users very peevish.\n\n    When Ben emails Mark Pilgrim and Anil responds selectively to some people and not others, this just continues that same damn class structure, that same insider/outsider thing that I've been watching Six Apart, and friends, foster over the last year.\n\nSpeaking as an end-user with no personal relationship with Ben, Mena or Anil, and no real emotional investment in \"Six Apart\":http://www.sixapart.com/ despite having been selected as an early alpha tester of MT 3.0, my immediate response to what Shelley is saying here is _whaaaha?_\n\nSo is she saying that Six Apart, because of this so-called \"insider/outsider thing,\" is saying that anyone who isn't a close personal friend of Ben and Mena, who are such suckers as to pay \$70+ for a license, are no longer wanted as MT users? Is she suggesting that because Six Apart is a larger business and not just Ben and Mena participating in a utopian, communal blogosphere, that they'll be unresponsive to the needs of bloggers? That because they're having trouble making the transition from being a mom-and-pop to being a corporate start-up, they can no longer be trusted?\n\nShit, man -- I ain't nevah trusted no Six Apart. I think 6A has seriously screwed up the MT3 launch, that in their rush to get this thing in the hands of developers they put out marketing materials and even license agreements that needed weeks, if not months, of additional work. Their identity crisis (only exacerbated by the very emotional responses to this release) is keeping them from having the self-awareness they need to be successful at marketing MT 3.0. You gotta know yourself in order to sell yourself.\n\nI still think that had 6A announced their _intention_ to charge for multiuser, multisite MT licenses but released MT 3.0 as a free \"technology preview\" with plans for adding way-cool features prior to its release as a commercial product, we would not be having these arguments."

    title: "Knives out"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we"
    body: "As is his wont, John Gruber of Daring Fireball has posted \"a rather insightful, moderate (yet critical) essay on the MT 3.0 debacle.\":http://daringfireball.net/2004/05/lead_zeppelin It follows on \"Brad Choate's post on the subject\":http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2004/05/15/mt3, which goes past the invective and tries to find out what has _really_ changed here. And finally, Mena Trott has \"clarified the MT 3 situation\":http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml without really acknowledging how badly Six Apart has screwed up here.\n\nHaving gotten over some anger here myself, I will acknowledge that the free version of MT isn't all that sucky, and Six Apart has a right to charge for their software. _However,_ the way they've handled the announcement of the new licensing terms is truly awful.\n\nIf, in the license terms, they intend for the restriction on \"weblogs\" to refer to separate sites running at separate URLs (as opposed to creating multiple blogs in the MT database to create sub-blogs of a single \"weblog\"), they should probably have considered rephrasing their description of the MT Free license restrictions: \"One active author, three weblog sites.\"\n\nAnd since (as Gruber points out) MT 3 is _not_ a release where new features are being added, the timing here is unbelievably bad. The sense is that we're being required to pay more for less functionality, even if that's not the whole truth.\n\nPerhaps Six Apart's biggest problem here is the branding. The source of all the invective is the history of Movable Type as a free product put out by a couple as a labor of love. MT 3.0 is (at least under the hood) a rather different animal than previous versions, and needed to be clearly distinguished as a _new_ commercial product, not the newly-commercial third-generation release of a beloved free product. This needed to be MT Pro.\n\nAnother big source of the problem: Six Apart has said all along that MT Pro would be the for-pay version, and that MT 3.0 would be a free upgrade. Now there is no MT Pro and regular 'ole MT is a pay version. It's not technically bait and switch, but it feels that way."

    title: "New Blogger, Movable Type"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "I'm more of a Movable Type and LiveJournal kind of blogger these days (the former for finely-crafted publishing, the latter for communicating with friends), but I am quite impressed with the new look and features that were added to Blogger..."
    body: "I'm more of a Movable Type and LiveJournal kind of blogger these days (the former for finely-crafted publishing, the latter for communicating with friends), but I am quite impressed with the new look and features that were added to Blogger last weekend. In addition to all the usual Blogger goodness, you get individual post pages (finally catching up with MT and TypePad) and some great new templates by some great old designers.\n\nMeanwhile, Six Apart has announced the pricing for Movable Type 3.0 (which is out today in a post-beta, pre-release Developer Edition). Yes, I said _pricing_: Movable Type is no longer a free, open hunk of Perl code. There is still a free version (called \"Movable Type Free\", natch), but it allows only one author and up to three blogs. Need any more authors, or any more blogs? Personal licenses start at \$99.95.[1]"
    extended: "However, this assumes that one's blog is absolutely, positively personal -- if you are using Movable Type in \"a business, organization, or institution, or in any income producing activity\" you are therefore a commercial user and must pay for a Commercial License, starting at \$299.95, for which you don't get any more blogs than a personal site does (5), but an extra two users (for a total of 5).\n\nIs there education pricing? Yes, but you have to contact Six Apart for a quote.\n\nPaid licenses include tech support (the free version is not supported at all), a Recently Updated key (so MT will tell Six Apart when you update and list your blog on the Movable Type home page) and guaranteed access to future upgrades. This assumes that a lot of people don't just run back to Blogger upon seeing those prices.\n\nBloggie Award-winning site \"Tenth-Muse\":http://www.tenth-muse.com/ is \"not at all happy\":http://www.tenth-muse.com/archives/002210.php with the announcement. \"This guy is pissed off too.\":http://www.megacity.org/blog/archives/001733.php And assuming that Six Apart is down with the whole 'don't be evil' meme, the trackbacks to \"Mena Trott's blog post announcing/discussing the new pricing\":http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml are pretty much venomous.\n\nWhy this is so fucking strange: MT doesn't do anything that can't be done just as easily with a competing, free package like pMachine or Textpattern, or very quickly and easily written by anyone with PHP-MySQL programming skills. What MT provides is a robust feature set with an easy-to-use web-based interface for administering one's blogs. It's not that it does anything earth-shattering; heretofore people have used it for convenience and because Ben and Mena are so damned cute.\n\nOf course, if for \$99.95 one got all the functionality of the current version 2.6x (unlimited users and blogs) for use on personal sites _and_ they threw in a Recently Updated key _and_ a registered copy of Ecto (the desktop client for MT and TypePad that is owned by another Joi Ito-funded company), and perhaps also that Palm client they've been alluding to so that Treo 600ers can moblog, _then_ you have something worth the money. A total blogging solution for \$100? That may still send a lot of MT users running to Textpattern or Blogger, but it would provide an incentive to stick around, as opposed to a stick shoved up our...um, yes. But to tell people that they will have to pay for the privilege of _losing_ some features...well, that's not at all kosher.\n\nfn1. There is promotional pricing on all MT 3.0 Developer Edition licenses; the Personal License starts at \$69.95, and Commercial Licenses start at \$199.95."

    body: "At least some of these are made up. Many of them are true.\n\n* Boston Rob proposed to Amber. She accepted.\n\n* Big Tom deeply hurt and Big Tom deeply drunk: not much visible difference.\n\n* Amber won.\n\n* Jerri _tried_ to make some point about how blah blah their friendships yada yada _ENTERTAINMENT!!!_ yak yak yak, and then she left during a commercial break, becoming the first Survivor to quit the show _after_ the winner was announced.\n\n* Amber got to give away an SUV -- a Chevy Equinox -- that was arguably nicer than Rob's Chevy Colorado pickup, and more likely to cause death than Amber's Chevy Malibu Maxx. She gave it to Shii Ann.\n\n* Richard Hatch took Rob's betrayal of Lex and Kathy less personally than Lex and Kathy did.\n\n* Sue got an Extreme Makeover. She now looks better than Jenna Lewis, for whom going on _Survivor_ was a good move because it keeps her away from the eyeliner for a few, uh, weeks.\n\n* Jenna Morasca's pain has been healed by a few, uh, months of Ethan-lovin'.\n\n* CBS decided that they didn't want fans bitching about the wrong person winning _two_ million dollars, so they made Mark Burnett give the long-rumored second million as an \"audience award\" of sorts: go to [the Survivor website](http://www.cbs.com/survivor/) (or text-message a number I would have written down if I used Cingular) and vote for which of the 18 Survivor All-Stars you want to see win a million dollars despite not necessarily outwitting, outplaying or outlasting. I will be voting for Rupert, and would not be surprised to see Rupert, Lex or even Boston Rob win the second million, although Rupert definitely seems to have the biggest cheering section.\n\nLest any of you Amber-haters out there think she totally lucked out, winning three cars (even though she had to give one away), a million dollars, a one-in-eighteen shot at _another_ million dollars and a huge diamond engagement ring, just think about the cost: Boston Rob. Every day. For the rest. Of her life. (Or until she overcomes enough Catholic guilt to file the divorce papers.)\n\nAnd lest any of you Boston Rob-haters think he totally lucked out, winning over a hundred thousand bucks, a new truck and getting engaged to his very own Kay Adams, just think about the cost: a guy named Bucky Bo now thinks he's a prize asshole. And believe me, these Virginia goat farmers know their assholes."

    title: "The Daily Show vs. Nader"

    description: "Voting for Nader is dumb. And I am so not pining for Lucy."
    body: "I respect my contemporaries' right to vote with their hearts, minds or whatever other organs they choose to this November, and throw their support behind whichever candidate they feel is right for our nation[1].\n\nHopefully, however, with the help of tonight's _Daily Show_, a few of them will realize the truth: a vote for Ralph Nader is like having drunken sex with a close friend: feels pretty good thinking about it, and pretty good doing it, but the pain and humiliation that follows just might drive you to suicide. Or should, if you weren't a self-important asshole who can't understand why you just can't fuck around with, uh, politics. This is a post about politics, and not at all about any fantasies I may be having about any friends or co-workers or neighbors or, uh, um...hey, look, it's Elvis! M-Mitchell! Yeah, Elvis Mitchell!.\n\nI went over this a bunch of times in 2000 (before Florida gave me something more earth-shattering to talk about) and I'll go over it again: voting for Nader is dumb. He has a lot of great ideas, but does he have a plan for working within the system to turn them into policy? Oh, right -- he has the moral high ground, and the system is corrupt, and we don't need your steeeenking system anyway. \n\nAnd as Pres. Bush has so capably demonstrated, the President doesn't need the Congress of an effective staff of advisers and policy-makers to change the way America works -- he just needs a national tragedy and a really big marketing budget. So who's to say that Nader can't do the same with a ragtag band of idealistic yahoos with no government experience, no marketing budget and a platform that's really nice if you still believe that America even _has_ a working class.\n\nIf Lisa Rein or someone puts up an online archive of the Nader segment I'll put up a link.\n\nfn1. And, of course, for the Iraqi nation."

But in a broader sense, I have been waiting for this moment since April of _last_ year, when I first learned that <a href=\"http://www.benandjerrys.com/\">Ben & Jerry's</a> even did a Free Cone Day the day _after_ it happened.\r\n\r\nMy Free Cone was <a href=\"http://www.benandjerrys.com/our_products/flavor_details.cfm?product_id=141\">Dublin Mudslide</a>, which is Irish cream ice (uh) cream with double-chocolate chip cookie pieces and some kind of chocolatey coffee swirl. It met our required parameters for ice cream goodness.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, B&J's had people soliciting voters to register as part of a thing they're doing with Rock The Vote. When asked, I informed the gentleman in the Carhartt jacket that my vote had already been rocked and did not require further rocking, thanks. He shook his head and moved on to a rather large black woman whose Kerry button should really have answered the question before he asked it.\r\n\r\nSo no more free Ben & Jerry's until next year. However, it's not the last we'll see of free ice cream: Baskin-Robbins has their annual Free Scoop Night tomorrow."

    title: "Miscellany"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we announce an event and bitch a little about Kill Bill Vol. 2."
    body: "What follows is a brief rundown of what's going on in Practical-land.\n\nh2. Sleek but affordable\n\nOur first-ever public event, tentatively called PLAY, will be going down here in Chicago on May 3. It's a microcinema screening curated by myself and fellow SAIC senior Bobby Shepherd focusing on works that are aesthetically or thematically playful, and which coincidentally are made by friends of ours. Of course, when those friends include such up-and-coming young mandarins of the Chicago video scene as Haoyan Zhang (who owes me one for all those times I drove him home from high school), who needs a call for entries?\n\nIt looks like the venue is gonna be \"Rodan\":http://chicago.citysearch.com/profile/38696226?cslink=roundup_name_noncust&#38;ulink=roundup__roundupentity1-11_1__0_profile_5_1 in Wicker Park, which seems a bit more on the hipster side than Bobby and myself would have preferred, but I think I can liven up the proceedings with some funny lamps and inflatable Godzillas.\n\nIf it weren't for art, mind you, I wouldn't dream of questioning Rodan's decor; it gives wood paneling a good name. And their beer is surprisingly cheap, given the neighborhood.\n\nMore information (including confirmation on the venue) coming soon.\n\nh2. Killing Kill Bill Billing\n\nDid _Kill Bill Vol. 2_ really _need_ twenty minutes of end credits? Tarantino's now-completed grindhouse epic is one big act of cinematic masturbation, and he is nowhere more masturbatory than in the mishmash of fonts, styles, music and whatnot that comes after Uma kills Bill. This is not a good thing.\n\nThe retro-inflected credits for _Kill Bill Vol. 1_ were fun and helped to set up these two rather strange movies. These end credits just outstay their welcome. I mean, when you have to sit through a full title card for the gaffer (not that the gaffer, the lead electrician on a picture, isn't important) before you even get to \"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino\", someone's having a little too much fun, and I think his name is Quentin.\n\nEspecially since _Vol. 2_ is the more subtle and somber of the two movies. Where the first one was almost nothing but flash, this one is like a long, longing last look between Uma and Carradine. We do get an epic Yuen Wo-Ping-choreographed sword battle between Uma and Darryl Hannah, but really that's just a sideshow to the drama between Bill and _BLEEP_.\n\nI think this one will require more than one viewing, at least once in a marathon with _Vol. 1_, to really sink in. The best description I can give is that it's _Empire Strikes Back_ to _Vol. 1_'s _Return of the Jedi_, in the sense that the focus is not on action fun but rather on character and dialogue. And some _Vol. 1_ fans who are expecting a repeat of all that wacky carnage will be decidedly disappointed.\n\nh2.  Why the lengthy span between postings here?\n\nChalk it up at least partly to the flu, and partly to me actually using my LiveJournal. Yes, I have one, but certainly not to replace Practical: my LJ is read by my friends Renee, Celeste and Lucy, which makes it a good forum for personal posts, whereas I like to stick to business over here.\n\nNo, I will not provide a link to my LJ here. You smell; you're not allowed."

I appear to be coming down with something, some mysterious new ailment that not even mighty Halls Mentho-Lyptus Drops(!!!) can cure.\n\nI blame the time I spent walking around in the cold in Wicker Park last Monday night doing some apartment scoping. From that experience I learned two things:\n\n* I really should take a look at the weather forecast for the evening before I plan my schoolday attire at _frickin' noon_, so I can know if the Kenneth Cole sportcoat that is entirely useful and appropriate at noon will get me killed at quarter of seven.\n\n* Wicker Park is a hipster-ridden hellhole, and I really don't need to pay that much to live in a neighborhood just so I can walk to Myopic Books.\n\n* Except that I do, I just can't afford it.\n\nSo this week Wicker Park has given me the killer death flu, scared Lucy and overcharged me for beer. This confirms my belief that there is nothing good to be found on the Blue Line."

Like, I own what I consider to be the only almost-perfect seasons of _Buffy_, and I will be buying the current season of _Angel_ when it comes out. When I strike it rich, I'll probably go back and pick up season one of _24_ and most (if not all) of _Deep Space Nine_.\n\nAs unwieldy as the \"Complete xth Season\" concept can seem, I hate \"best of\" releases even more, which is why I've been dreaming of hearing the following words all my life:\n\n> [SURVIVOR: BORNEO - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON COMING TO DVD MAY 11](http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B0001ZDKXI/demareesworld/)"
    extended: "The idea of a reality show on DVD may sound about as fun as a hardcover collection of the _Best of People Magazine_ to some readers, but if I may be so bold, those readers don't know _Survivor_. The joy of that show is that even if it is ultimately a really ambitious game show, the casting is so good that by the time you get to last fall's _Pearl Islands_, the game's surprise twists finally start to feel like the cheats they are. How dare the producers try to upstage Rupert!\n\nI've always described _Survivor_ as \"C-SPAN meets extreme sports\" -- it's like a sports show for smart people. There's the challenges, which can be goofy reality show games but which sometimes are almost staggering in their ingenuity. The twists (which started in Season Three, when the tribes were forced to switch some members) are cheats, but they work because we care about the characters, and the show is presented as a totally character-driven, if unscripted, drama.\n\nAny _Survivor_ geek can attest to the pit in their stomach during _Thailand_ when the producers fooled the tribes into thinking they were merging, a dirty trick that resulted in Shii Ann (a fan-favorite castaway who is currently on the _All-Stars_ edition) getting voted off. Or just about anything involving Jonny Fairplay or Rupert on _Pearl Islands_.\n\nHell, I'd lay down some coin just to have the season two episode where Mike \"Col. Kurtz\" Skupin kills a pig and paints his face with its blood. This is an ordinary guy (well, a Christian conservative software designer from the Midwest) who decides, extemporaneously, to adorn himself with the blood of another creature. There's that, and the challenge in Africa where they had to drink cow's blood for immunity. Why, this might be the bloodiest show on TV. These people love them their blood."

It's a web-based RSS reader. It's pointless beyond all reason. Brilliant!\n\nI am, perhaps, being mean.

Like this: [this is _my_ Kinja page](http://www.kinja.com/user/daviddemaree).\n\nOf course, if one's own feeds are in your Kinja profile, and you do a rebuild of the whole site to purge it of penile implant spam...yeah.\n\nAddendum: Part of the why of Kinja is that it not only displays your bookmarks, but links to pages _that link to_ your bookmarks. Impressive from a technical standpoint, but less so considering that I'm so far just seeing a lot of ref-backs to [Joelle's](http://www.tenth-muse.com/) before and after photos.

I do sometimes wonder how much computing work has to go into enforcing Hotmail's 2 MB quota for all 17 million of its users.\n\nThis could work in a bizarro inverse of the Red Lobster Hypothesis: just because a few <del>psychos</del> people are using all 1 GB of their storage doesn't mean that anyone else will. In fact, most people will probably use less than a tenth of that capacity, and in the meantime _Google will have amassed copious marketing data on the e-mail habits of its customers._\n\nDo I believe that Google will be spying on our private correspondence to some evil ends? Yeah, I really believe that knowing how many spams for penile implants I get in an average day is vital to their plans of world domination.\n\nI do know that if any company is in a position to pull off such an ambitious project, it's Google, even if they did only get into it because somebody (probably Orkut) lost a bet. Yahoo seems to believe that they're in the media business, while Microsoft continues to mistake pissing people off for surprising and delighting their customers.\n\nGoogle will be able to accomplish their evil schemes and get away with it because they know how to make the proverbial trains run on time. You know, kind of like the Nazis did."

Suffice to say that Practical's \"TypeKey\":http://www.typekey.com/ support is already in the bag, and if anyone wants to know how to make TypeKey play nicely with \"Smarty\":http://smarty.php.net/, I'm your monster.\n\nThe new pages have a cleaner, easier-to-read look, should load somewhat faster and will be much, _much_ better organized. Comments will seem much less like an afterthought.\n\nI consider this new design an evolution of the current one; all the same basic ideas are there, but moving text to the left side of the screen seems to open the whole thing up, make it seem...I dunno -- _brighter_ and nicer. It breathes.\n\nFans will note that the Spaghetti Boy is absent. I haven't yet found a home for him, but he will hold a place of honor, guarding the home page from various invading forces.\n\nLinks and Photos haven't quite been worked into the new design yet, but I'm thinking that I'll work them into the same organizational structure as Movable Type, so that (for instance) if you go to _/2004/03/photos_, you'll get the photos from this month. There are still some minor technical challenges I'll need to work out, but the result will be that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Practicalmadness</span> will feel -- _finally_ -- like a single cohesive website.\n\nWoo-hoo."

    title: "TypeKey"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we ramble at length about comments."
    body: "Okay, this is getting out of hand. Many capital (and non-capital) fellows (and non-fellows) of the blogging community are talking [TypeKey](http://www.typekey.com/), which is [Six Apart's](http://www.sixapart.com/) new centralized authentication system for [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) comments.\n\n> <http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/000539/>  \n> <http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/sensuoustechnology/typekey_final_act.htm>\n> <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/22/you-blow-me>\n\nAs far as I can tell, the arguments against TypeKey (so far) are:\n\n* It's centralized, so if it goes down, nobody can comment on my weblog.\n* Now that they're a successful company and not just Ben and Mena Trott coding in their apartment, I don't trust Six Apart with my data.\n* If commenters have to register, they'll stop commenting.\n* If people can ban commenters, or if Six Apart can ban them globally, people won't feel they can speak freely, which will hurt the blogosphere.\n* Did we mention that centralized services are unreliable and bad?\n\nThe arguments _for_ TypeKey are:\n\n* The people who are against TypeKey are stupid bastards or self-absorbed bitches.\n\nThere _is_ an argument to be made for TypeKey (and here in a minute, I'll make it); I just happen to be surprised how quickly the discussion of this new service has devolved into sarcasm and personal attacks. Get a life, people."
    extended: "Now, then. I think there are many bloggers who would welcome the introduction of something like TypeKey. Its detractors talk about the potential for abuse, the potential for problems with a central server going down, the potential for people to decide it's no longer worth the effort to comment if they have to register. My own feeling is that while those potentialities are real and worth considering, there are also many potential benefits that, for some weblog owners, may outweigh the negatives:\n\n* ### One doesn't need to know Perl, or any other language\n\n    While one does need to know _something_ about running and installing Perl scripts to get Movable Type running on their server, I for one have absolutely no Perl coding experience. I'm well-versed in PHP/MySQL, but why should I have to write my own system to get the benefits of comment registration? One of the things I love about MT is its ease of use; one clear advantage to TypeKey is that its ease of use and functionality, when paired with MT 3.0, will be far beyond anything I can cobble together in my spare time.\n\n    I _can_ write my own, and I suspect that many MT users could as well. But why should we, when you can activate TypeKey with the flick of a form control?\n\n* ### Known abusers can be banned globally.\n\n    Some of the detractors are mentioning this as a negative, but from all indications it is not Six Apart's intention to police the blogosphere. We, the readers and writers of weblogs, will police ourselves, but there now will exist the power for individuals who are known to abuse our hospitality by leaving spam, or by attempting to attack the servers with repeated comments, to be banned globally.\n\n    This is probably the biggest question surrounding TypeKey: How bad does a problem commenter have to be in order to be banned globally? We're not talking about excommunicating someone because they called somebody a bitch on one weblog -- we're talking about the people who use the publicly-available comment feature to attack servers.\n\n    Why I mention this as a positive: TypeKey has the potential to be a tremendous resource for the blogging community to police itself, by reporting problem commenters in order to protect and strengthen the community. I believe there should be very strict guidelines for a global ban, and that such an action should be used only against those TypeKey users who are attempting to attack a system, as opposed to merely spamming.\n\n* ### One login, thousands of blogs\n\n    Yes! Yes yes yes! Like I said, many bloggers can write their own login systems, and it would be a small matter for Six Apart to integrate a site-specific login system into Movable Type. _But_ the reason for TypeKey to be a global system is to enable someone to take part in the blogosphere without keeping track of logins across however many blogs one cares to read. That maintains ease-of-use without requiring everyone to use TypePad; it's a good compromise.\n\n* ### Promotes accountability by commenters, whether they're spamming or not.\n\n    Note that TypeKey authentication, where required, is required only to _post_ a comment; comments are still publicly viewable to everyone. I've had problems in the past where even a legitimate commenter (someone I knew in real life) left a dozen identical comments with a bogus e-mail address.\n\n    I believe in taking responsibility for what you post on a weblog, whether you're its owner or just a commenter stopping by. This isn't a space for graffiti -- it's a discussion, and since I can't look you in the eye, I hope you don't mind if I get your name and/or e-mail address so long as I promise not to do anything bad with it. I honestly don't care what people post to my comments, but I do have two requests:\n\n    * That it be on-topic. (No comments about penile implants on my post about winter weather.)\n    * That you leave a legitimate name and/or e-mail address.\n\n    This raises an issue: would the guy mentioned above, who responded to a post that was largely _about him_, have refrained from speaking up if I had required him to leave his name? That's his prerogative, and I have no problem with that. But I believe firmly that if you're adding something of value to a discussion (as was our mystery commenter), there is no reason to hide your identity from me.\n\n    I don't have a problem with people not making their identities _public_; one advantage of TypeKey is that one can have a \"display name\" and opt not to display their e-mail addresses to the public. Having a TypeKey identity just gives me more confidence that you're here because you have something to say, not because you like seeing your sloppy typescript on my web pages.\n\nThere's still a lot we don't know about TypeKey, but it's safe to assume that it won't be the perfect solution for everybody. However, I think that it could be a great thing for _the weblog community_. Nobody's forcing you, in the same way that nobody forces you to give candy to rugrats on Halloween. But it could be the neighborly thing to do."

    title: "It Takes All Kinds"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we examine the case for Bush."
    body: "Richard Clarke, who was a top anti-terrorism adviser to the Clinton and Bush II administrations, has gone public on _60 Minutes_ with certain...revelations. It has been previously reported that Clinton left office having briefed (or at least left a Post-It for) Pres. Bush regarding al Qaeda; there are rumblings that such a warning even included specific mention of a major al Qaeda operation that turned out to be the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nSo what did the Bush people do about it? _Nothing._\n\n> \"We had a terrorist organization that was going after us! Al Qaeda. That should have been the first item on the agenda. And it was pushed back and back and back for months.\n\n> \"There's a lot of blame to go around, and I probably deserve some blame, too. But on January 24th, 2001, I wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice asking for, urgently -- underlined urgently -- a Cabinet-level meeting to deal with the impending al Qaeda attack. And that urgent memo-- wasn't acted on.\n\n> \"I blame the entire Bush leadership for continuing to work on Cold War issues when they back in power in 2001. It was as though they were preserved in amber from when they left office eight years earlier. They came back. They wanted to work on the same issues right away: Iraq, Star Wars. Not new issues, the new threats that had developed over the preceding eight years.\"\n\n>  Clarke finally got his meeting about al Qaeda in April, three months after his urgent request. But it wasn't with the president or cabinet. It was with the second-in-command in each relevant department. For the Pentagon, it was Paul Wolfowitz.\n\n> Clarke relates, \"I began saying, 'We have to deal with bin Laden; we have to deal with al Qaeda.' Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said, 'No, no, no. We don't have to deal with al Qaeda. Why are we talking about that little guy? We have to talk about Iraqi terrorism against the United States.'\n\n> Clarke went on to add, \"There's absolutely no evidence that Iraq was supporting al Qaeda, ever.\"\n\nSo at the risk of stating the obvious, here's the logic that the Bush administration is asking us to accept in voting for their second term:\n\n* We were attacked on Sept. 11th by terrorists.\n* We had no idea and could not possibly have prevented it. If we could have, it was the FBI and CIA's fault. We have solved this problem by creating a new government department which includes the FBI, but not the CIA. Since then, we have blamed the CIA for anything that goes wrong.\n* We went to war in Afghanistan and overthrew a brutal Islamic regime that was harboring al Qaeda. We still have troops there, although we never captured or killed Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar or al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. By all indications, the Taliban is regrouping to overthrow the weak provisional government. Again.\n* We went to war in Iraq because somebody (may have been the CIA over here, who may have been smoking crack, or someone in British intelligence, who may have been smoking British crack) told us Saddam had inquired as to the possibility of kinda sorta maybe purchasing some Nigerian yellowcake, clear evidence of a major WMD program that can only be for one purpose: making nuclear airplanes and attacking the U.S. with chemical shoe bombs.\n* Even if the yellowcake connection didn't pan out, we read in an Italian tabloid about a guy who had talked to a guy who knew a guy who had heard from somebody's wife's trainer's shrink's cleric that Saddam and Osama bin Laden were (gasp!) both facing Mecca at the same time on the same day -- clear evidence of conspiracy that was only substantiated when both evildoers issued videotapes that included an Arabic word that could be translated either as \"crusader\" or \"croissant\".\n* The connection between 9/11 and Iraq becomes more tenuous here; of course it's not because of Islam, because Saddam's was a largely secular regime. And it can't be because of the oil, because everybody knows that al Qaeda's money comes from construction. And it can't possibly be because following the policy of punishing nations that harbor al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists would eventually lead to us bombing the hell out of every Starbucks in Riyadh.\n\n    We can only assume that it's because an American spy in Baghdad heard Saddam clapping at the television during news coverage of the 9/11 attacks. Was he watching CNN, or was he watching, perhaps, _Predator_? Was he clapping at the charred flesh of innocent victims in NYC, Washington and Pennsylvania, or was he just getting to that moment when Jesse Ventura gets killed by an alien monster? Since Saddam is an evildoer -- and thus would clearly be spending his evenings plotting our doom, and never watching movies -- we can only assume that he was applauding the terrorist attacks.\n\n    Holy shit! Applauding the terrorist attacks??? _Bin Laden_ applauds terrorist attacks! He always applauds terrorist attacks! There! There's the connection!\n* Meanwhile (mumble mumble) shitty economy (mumble) outsourcing to Bangalore (mumble mumble) two hours to get through airport checkin (mumble) Colin Powell is a sad, sad shell of a man.\n\nI think I can see a case for re-electing Bush in there somewhere. But then again, I'm crazy."

    title: "Dogville"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which a film is reviewed, and Dramamine is taken."
    body: "I just saw the new Lars von Trier picture _Dogville_ (starring Nicole Kidman) at the [Film Center](http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/), and it is spectacular. There is, unfortunately, the same \"von Trier effect\" I experienced at _Dancer in the Dark_ 3.5 years ago, but not even a nasty headache could prevent me from loving this brilliant film.\n\n<p class=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/dogville02.jpg\" height=\"228\" width=\"350\" alt=\"dogville02\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999;\" /></p>\n\nWhat follows is my review in the format of an FAQ."
    extended: "\n### What's it all about?\n\nLike, the plot? There's this township in the Rockies called Dogville. It is tiny (about the size of, oddly enough, a small soundstage), sparsely populated (no more than 22 men, women and children) and poor. While they have a mission house, they have no pastor, only one store and no schoolhouse. What they do have is a strong sense of community, which may or may not be a good thing.\n\nAnyway, the town's self-styled intellectual, Tom Edison, Jr. (Paul Bettany) feels that the town -- and all of America -- has a problem with \"acceptance\", and holds meetings where he lectures the townsfolk on morality. He doesn't accomplish much in his quest to illustrate his argument, until one evening when a beautiful woman in a fur coat named Grace (Nicole Kidman) happens into town, chased by gangsters.\n\nHe convinces the townsfolk to let her stay for two weeks, and convinces her that the way to get people to accept her is to offer to help them. So she does, and they come to accept her, and the town comes alive with the sense of joy and excitement she brings. And Tom even confesses that he's in love with her, and she with him, and it's just one big lovely small-town fable...\n\n_...until_ the cops show up saying that Grace is wanted for a string of recent bank robberies. The townsfolk know that Grace is innocent (the robberies occurred since she's been in Dogville), but nonetheless feel that, as Tom puts it, \"in a business sense, your presence here has just become more costly.\" So she agrees to work more hours for less wages, because she loves the town and her friends so much and hates to put them in danger.\n\nAnd things generally get worse from there.\n\n\n### How much worse?\n\nLet me put it this way: the first two or three times she's raped are probably the _nicest_, least humiliating things that happen to her in the second half of the picture.\n\n\n### I don't understand. This sounds like a heartless, horrible movie. How is it fabulous?\n\nIt's all about the ending, dude. The ending is also pretty heartless if you came into _Dogville_ expecting a nice piece of small-town Americana, but assuming that you find yourself, after 2 1/2 hours, rooting for Grace (which you can't help but feel, thanks to Kidman's cunning performance) I think you'll find the ending as cathartic as fresh air, clean water and a nice, long orgasm.\n\nCarrying the sexual metaphor further still, von Trier telegraphs the ending at least 15 minutes before things start going down, and in such a way that you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, and yet still relish it as much or more. If the movie is Grace's courtship with human cruelty, the buildup to the ending is foreplay, and the ending itself is the consummation of the relationship. \n\n\n### Wait, you said something about 2 1/2 hours. How long _is_ this movie?\n\nUh, (mumble mumble) 177 minutes (mumble COUGH.)\n\n\n### I see. Um, there's something I've been meaning to ask about _Dogville_. I heard from a friend that, um, there are no sets?\n\nAh, yes. Um, that's...yeah.\n\nI'll level with you -- there is exactly one set: the town.\n\n\n### Oh, okay. So it's like a normal town, but on a soundstage, right?\n\nUm...uh...not quite. It's..._sort of_ normal...except...(mumble mumble) _there are no walls_.\n\n\n### _What???_\n\nNo walls, no trees, no doors (although you hear doors), no bushes (although Lauren Bacall spends ages tending them), no dog (and yet...we _hear_ a dog), no natural light or climate (although von Trier makes brilliant use of lighting and set decoration to suggest not only time of day, but the season, and--)\n\n\n### But -- _there are no walls!_ What do you mean _no walls???_\n\nThe walls are signified by white lines drawn on the floor of the set. Basically, the characters live on nothing but a floorplan. But the actors are able, through their performances, to suggest a whole landscape. If you've ever seen a Dorothea Lange photograph of Depression-era America, you can fill in the blanks for yourself. If not, von Trier shows you a bunch of them over the end credits.\n\n\n### What is the point?\n\n[As von Trier has said to the _New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/movies/21SCOT.html), by limiting himself to only the most essential pieces of set dressing, he had to think long and hard about what pieces to include. Each \"house\" has maybe one or two key pieces of furniture that are deeply connected to its inhabitant(s). And just so things don't get _too_ weird, all the cars are real, even if they seem to be driving into and out of nowhere.\n\nWhat's more, it generalizes the town: Dogville could be anywhere -- that it's in America is not so much a statement about Americans but community. Being a relatively young nation of colonists, interlopers and refugees, Americans don't have the same ages-old identification with the land as do Europeans -- the same story set in Denmark, even a nonexistent nowhere town in Denmark, must therefore have a connection to Danish history (along with literary sources from Beowulf to Hamlet) and all the baggage that entails.\n\nI think what von Trier is trying to do here is to make a statement about morality, especially the morality of wealth, power and servitude, that if set in Europe would become unnecessarily complicated by European politics. I guess it's our blessing and curse as Americans that we are such a disconnected people that our country serves rather well as a blank canvas for all kinds of observations about human nature.\n\n\n### Um, yeah. I can see that.\n\nYeah.\n\n\n### So...this movie sounds pretty boring. Three hours long? No sets? Do we at least get to see Nicole Kidman naked?\n\nNope. You do, however, get to see Stellan Skarsgard's package.\n\n\n### OH MY GOD!!! EEEW!!! EEW!!!\n\nIt's okay! Don't worry -- it's from a really wide angle and the camera was way out of focus.\n\n\n### I still feel dirty.\n\nThink how Nicole must feel.\n\n\n### Good point. Anyway -- boring?\n\nNot so much! You do spend all three hours within this _one_ set, but von Trier makes expert use of lighting and camerawork to create a whole world within this one set. He never overcomes that whole Brechtian alienation effect thing, but I don't think he means to. We're aware that the world is artificial, but as a result we're forced to pay close attention to the people and their actions. We hear so much about their poverty, but we're never allowed to _see_ it, which might predispose us (as it predisposes Grace) to forgive them their crimes because of their suffering.\n\nWhich does lead me to the one interpretation of the film germane to American politics: it's not hard to see _Dogville_ as a Republican fairy tale, in which the townsfolk may be have-littles, but are thus morally justified to make demands of the town's only have-not, which in turn justifies Grace's actions when her own wealth and power are restored to her. It's the \"might makes right\" aspect of the American experience: to paraphrase von Trier again, Americans see poverty as  a failure of the individual, whereas Europeans (with their social democracies) tend to see it as a failure of the society. I don't think von Trier means _Dogville_ as a specific criticism of the current United States or of capitalism, but rather of the passive-aggressive evil that turns ordinary people into monsters through mob rule.\n\nAs for that running time, von Trier uses it quite well. He tells you on a title card at the front that it's a film \"told in nine chapters and a prologue.\" The cards announcing the chapters say a bit about what will happen in each chapter, which are each no more than 25 minutes long. And he makes good use of an ironic, dryly witty English narrator (voiced by John Hurt) to fill the empty space. Think _Barry Lyndon_, only much more acid.\n\n\n### I'm confused. Acid? Who's this Barry Lyndon? And what's Brechtian?\n\nNever mind.\n\n\n### Um, okay. So who's in it?\n\nThe aforementioned Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany and Stellan Skarsgard, all of whom are quite marvelous. Patricia Clarkson (who was a recent Oscar nominee for _Pieces of April_) is memorable as Skarsgard's scorned wife.\n\nCharacter actor Philip Baker Hall (a regular in P.T. Anderson's films, fabulous in _Magnolia_) plays Bettany's father, the town's retired doctor, and Siobhan Fallon Hogan (inexplicably, a von Trier regular perhaps best known as Elaine's roommate on _Seinfeld_) and Zeljko Ivanek provide some comic relief as the keeper of the mission house and a guy in \"the freight industry\", respectively.\n\nTurning performances you can probably imagine, if you're familiar at all with the actors, are Jeremy Davies and Chloe Sevigny. Let's just say that as regards these actors, remember that they'll be pulling residuals for \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Boys Don't Cry\" for a while now.\n\n\n### Which one was he?\n\nUpham.\n\n\n### I hated Upham.\n\nYou'll hate him here too.\n\n\n### What's this \"von Trier effect\" you keep talking about?\n\nOh, that. Lars von Trier shoots in digital video, using the PAL video standard at about 25 frames per second (FPS), which is then burned to 35mm motion picture film at 24 FPS. He also has a stylistic tendency to use a handheld camera (which is, like, _Blair Witch_ hella shaky) and shoot really tight, claustrophobic close-ups.\n\nThe von Trier Effect is the combination of these technical and stylistic decisions: there's noise from the video camera, grain from the motion picture film and blurring and strobing from the almost constant movement of the camera. What's more, von Trier shoots in 'Scope and so the messy video image fills up one's entire field of vision.\n\nYou may be wondering, what does this have to do with the price of popcorn?\n\n### I was, in fact, wondering that.\n\nIf you are at all prone to seasickness, von Trier's DV films just might make you heave. It is impossible to get a fix on anything on the screen while the camera is moving, because nothing is ever in focus. At the very least, the strobing may give you a headache in much the same way as does _Pokemon_ cartoons. I wouldn't be surprised if von Trier films give some people seizures.\n\nThis was easier to take than his last one, _Dancer in the Dark_, because of the sparse staging: there was less to try to fix one's eyes on. And von Trier was more willing to let the camera stay still for longer periods than in _Dancer_.\n\nOf course, it may just be me: I remember getting sick at IMAX movies when I was ten. But trust me: if you fear seagoing vessels, you may want to pick up some Dramamine along with your tickets.\n\n\n### So who should see this movie?\n\nCineastes. Fans of Nicole -- she's really good here. People who think Kubrick movies kick ass but are a little too sentimental. Anyone in blue states.\n\n\n### What's Dramamine?\n\nWell, um, Google defines it as \" the quality of being arresting or highly emoti\"-- oh, you mean the pills!\n\nFortunately, if you have to ask, you probably don't need to know."

    title: "Burma, Texas"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Like the laws against drunk driving, cocaine use and stealing elections, apparently this embargo applies only to people not named Bush."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/burma_texas.jpg\" height=\"229\" width=\"160\" alt=\"burma_texas\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 20px; border: 1px solid #999;\" />Dubya takes a stand on human rights by initiating a trade embargo against Burma. And like the laws against drunk driving, cocaine use and stealing elections, apparently this embargo only applies to people not named Bush, as it has been outed that the Bush-Cheney '04 campaign is selling [fleecy pullovers](http://www.georgewbushstore.com/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/scstore/600-1501.htm?L+scstore+nxyf1737+1079739928) made...oh, holy Jesus, is that..._Burma???_ [Newsday has the scoop.](http://www.newsday.com/business/ny-bzsell0319,0,1292393,print.story?coll=ny-top-headlines)\n\nCan't be. Nope. It is inconcievable that an organization as known for their grace, intelligence and dignity as the Bush presidential campaign would be so insensitive as to job their fleeces out to Burma. Unless...is there a town called Burma in Texas?\n\nOr perhaps this is a clever campaign marketing strategy: they will remind everyone of _Seinfeld_ by releasing a [J. Peterman](http://www.jpeterman.com/)-esque catalog of clothing and housewares, accompanied by lurid travelogue descriptions that highlight not only the unique character of every product, but how they exemplify just how, oh, _super_ the Bush II presidency has been.\n\nYou know, something like this:\n\n> ## Bush-Cheney Fleece Pullover\n\n> It was a peaceful, dim-cool morning in Burma when I encountered a nine-year-old boy. He was just coming home from a twelve hour workday in a humid, sweaty (uh) sweatshop, where he pricked his fingers forty-seven times with a rusty nail that he is forced to use to embroider the logos of greedy French and German corporations onto itchy synthetic fleece garments.\n\n> I offered him water from my canteen, which he accepted, and he gave me this pullover, saying, \"I made this for you, because while I am working for nine cents a day in this hellish Burmese hellhole, I dream of one day pulling myself up by my bootstraps and making the long journey to Bangalore, where I can find work for a wealthy American company as a customer service technician or clerical worker. It is you who give me hope, President Bush!\"\n\n> I keep this pullover by my pillow to remind me of the sacrifices made by young people like Aun-San in Burma, Chhunhakk in Cambodia and Omar in Malaysia in the name of freedom and democracy.\n\n> One color, \$49.95."

    body: "[An announcement has been made](http://typekey.sixapart.com/) by [Six Apart](http://movabletype.org/). I have only one, seemingly absurd comment:\n\n> <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">There is no such thing as Secret Window.</span>\n\nTrust me, it will all make sense in the end. Well, actually, it won't, but-- hey, look, there's Elvis! (pant pant pant why is running away so much like work?)\n\n## Okay, I _will_ say this\n\nThe Six Apart crew keep alluding to [their new TypeKey identity service](http://typekey.sixapart.com/) -- which is kind of like Microsoft Passport without the evil -- as being open to third-party development, which here means that those of us with websites will be able to offer TypeKey sign-in for _anything_, not just comment registration in Movable Type 3.0.\n\nWhich means that Reader Services (or any other registery goodness someone comes up with) could be available to anyone who has ever left a comment on a TypeKey-enabled blog _without_ additional registration. One secure user database maintained by people who, like, get _paid_ to deal with customer problems can service us all. This is starting to excite the geek in me.\n\nYou may, in fact, be wondering why we even _need_ registration for blog comments. A certain percentage of you may even have gotten stuck on this strange new word 'blog'. However, those of us pathetically dateless enough to know about these things care about these things, especially when you wake up to a dozen new comments on your site only to find that they're all from 'veronka' hawking penile implants on your pithy post about all the new soda products.\n\nThus comment registration. When it was first announced as part of MT 3.0, my big worry was having two different registration systems running on Practical. One reason why I even mess with Reader Services is that I can control every aspect of the experience there (albeit poorly), address problems if they occur and feel good about myself as a geek. If I can use TypeKey for Reader Services, that just makes my life so much easier it's not even funny."

Having \"addicted\":http://forums.egullet.com/index.php?showtopic=38866 our friend Elizabert to _bao_, we've been going to \n\"Wow Bao\":http://practicalmadness.com/m/a/2004/02/bao_wow_wow frequently, where we've found the combo meals to be quite a bargain. For just under five bucks, you get two of any _bao_ on the menu[1] plus a cup of the hot and sour broth or your choice of salad. Lunch for two people -- on \"North Michigan Avenue\":http://www.themagnificentmile.com/, mind you -- was about \$9.50.\n\nBeverages are sadly un-included; this is not a problem for those of us who get the broth with our meals, and frankly I might recommend plain (and free) water as the best pairing with these spicy things.\n\nWhere they've come up a-cropper is the current month's specialty _bao_, which is chocolate-ginger-coconut (pictured). Well, _I_ kinda like them, but Liz took one bite and found herself questioning the existence of a just and loving god. I grant that while it's not hard to get into the barbecued pork or Mongolian beef _bao_, a doughy steamed bun filled with hot fudge and toasted coconut is perhaps best left to those of us whose addiction to chocolate has been known to overcome our better judgement.[2]"
    extended: "fn1. Including the month's specialty _bao_, such as the chocolate-ginger-coconut one discussed above. This is contrary to what the menu says (\"<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">no combos</span>\"), but if you ask them, they will give you chocolate _bao_. Of course, that's assuming you _want_ to have one or more chocolatey buns with your pad thai/hot &#38; sour broth/salad.\n\nfn2. Case in point: the chocolate \"BBs\" at \"Fox &#38; Obel's\":http://www.fox-obel.com/ bakery. They are undeniably fabulous: they're rich chocolate fudge cake covered with coconut and then dipped in chocolate. They're also undeniably pricey, at \$3.95 a quarter-pound. Which is about the weight of one ping pong ball-sized BB."

    title: "Meritocracy Is Dead"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I lament the death of the American middle class."
    body: "There is a fantastic article by Brendan I. Koerner on the Village Voice's website about \"what he calls the 'ambition tax'\":http://www1.villagevoice.com/issues/0411/fkoerner.php -- how more and more, young Americans go into crippling debt to buy an increasingly long shot at the American dream, while the children of wealthy parents are able to have dream careers because they can afford to take on post-graduate education or unpaid internships rather than flipping lattes like the rest of us.\n\nKoerner makes the rather apt analogy to the Japanese salaryman, which does remind me that I read somewhere recently of a trend toward Western-style \"merit-based\" advancement at Japanese companies, which is helping to make companies more competitive by encouraging new ideas, but also introducing a potentially devastating destabilizing element into Japanese society: if you find yourself in your 30s, fighting for territory with young turks who had more advantages than you did, what does that do to your view of the world?"
    extended: "I remember this being a huge theme in the U.S. back in the 80s and early 90s (such as I could notice it, being like 10 years old at the time): the shock of older corporate drones as they found themselves competing with, or managed by, young, cocky, over-educated and often over-privileged kids who came in and pretty much wiped their asses with the older workers' world. It's been such a part of American industry since then that it's not even talked about -- it's a sitcom joke now, the older guy who couldn't make enough of himself to escape being supervised by a 19-year-old.\n\nIt's funny because it's true.\n\nThere's something distinctly American about this -- this is where free-market capitalism completely overruns any sense of community or humanity, and gets right back to the kind of insecapable socio-economic Darwinism that we thought (or deluded ourselves into thinking) we'd killed in the U.S.\n\nThe ones with the best chance for success are already successful; if you are not successful, you cannot become successful. And only the strong survive -- while the rich indulge themselves, the poor are being punished for their poverty such that the distinction between poverty and middle-class is way fuzzier than it's ever been. It feels like class in this country is now as polarized as its politics: you're rich or you're poor, you're feeling the pinch or you're not.\n\nThese are, of course, generalizations -- the main theme I want to get at here is the new air of hopelessness surrounding the economy, as if hope is a luxury reserved for those whose bright futures are already bought and paid for. At the risk of getting political (and even more general), it's the classic Republican idea: since success is its own reward, poverty must be its own punishment. This is why the GOP hates welfare, arts grants and student aid.\n\nMy biggest worry/fear: that the problem is much deeper and more systemic than even this suggests, that the class differences are so profound that even with such welcome moves as Harvard's new policy to waive tuition for lower-income students, the lower-income kids who might benefit will be an aberration: that those people will be better off, but most people are still (relatively) fucked, and the easy road to power, glory and money is still most accessible to the rich kids whose Harvard tuition is charged to an Amex Black Card.\n\nThis concerns me not because there's anything wrong with being a rich kid, _per se_, but it hardly seems like the makings of a strong society. It starts to look suspiciously like pre-Revolutionary France or Russia, except for the fact that you can't really _have_ a coup d'etat in a country this size, and as such we're fucked."

    description: "In which we celebrate St. Patrick the only way we know how."
    body: "I would not have believed it, but day-old India Pale Ale tastes none too different from fresh India Pale Ale. That is, it is a flavor best described with terms like \"vomit\", \"essence of Cream of Wheat\" and \"why oh why did I not buy Honkers Ale?\"\n\nBeing rather out of the loop, I had no idea that the St. Patrick's Day parade thing was today (you'd think I'd have known, seeing as I live on State Street and all), and as such was rather shocked to note that, when I padded out of the house for milk, bread and chocolate toffees, everyone's got their green on and there was a line out the door at Govnor's Pub at Lake Street. And I'm like, _dude_.\n\nIt seemed like kind of a touristy crowd, and Guinness- and Miller-provided SPD decorations notwithstanding, I'd have pegged Govnor's as more of a wannabe British pub than a wannabe Irish pub. I would further assume that the wannabe Irish would, in fact, want nothing to do with the wannabe Brits on this day of drinkin', and that these people must not have gotten the message that all tourists are to do their drinking in specially marked \"Tourist Trap Zones\" like Fado, or even Celtic Crossings.\n\nIt can, then again, be argued that _all_ of Chicago between Belmont and Roosevelt is one humungous tourist trap, as perhaps indicated by the number of H&#38;M bags I saw walking around the place.\n\nI have no Guinness on the premises; however, I trust that the leprechaun patrol will find it satisfactory that my selection of high-falutin' German and Czech beers come in green glass bottles, and that I have green martini fixins. Also that at least 30% of the items in my fridge are presently green. And if they pinch me, I'll make them eat some of them."

It came up as an example of Michel Chion's concept of the \"acousmetre,\" who is a character that exists _only_ as sound and thus has special powers, but loses them once he/she is seen. It's an amazingly freaky film, as super-criminal (and Hitler stand-in) Dr. Mabuse's writings take on a life of their own, setting in motion a plot to destroy the world or summot.\n\nFritz Lang released it in 1933 -- the same year Hitler came to power -- and the rise of Nazism obviously informed the story. A madman whose ideas set in motion a faceless conspiracy of destruction? Hmm, let me think of who that reminds me of. It was considered a threat to the regime and banned by Goebbels; Lang defected to the U.S. shortly thereafter, making (among many other fabulous films) the proto-noir _Scarlet Street_, another favorite from the 30s.\n\nAnd has anyone else noticed a huge trend toward really striking, high-design covers at Criterion this year? Criterion's discs have always looked better than other publishers', but contrast the relatively pedestrian covers for _Seven Samurai_ and _Seventh Seal_ with this fabulous halftoned picture for _Mabuse_, or the use of line art, design and typography on new releases like _Ikiru_ and _The Rules of the Game_. They're really cool."

    title: "Spielberg and beer"

    description: "In which we consider Schindler's List, and drink ale."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/schindlers_list.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\" alt=\"schindlers_list\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; border: 1px solid #999\" />We are presently enjoying a bottle of Goose Island India Pale Ale, which is hoppy but quite good. We have just watched Peter Jackson's _Heavenly Creatures_ on Bravo, which was probably not the best way to experience that lovely film for the first time, but has the added virtue of being free.\n\nIt is interesting to note, or perhaps wonder at, the ways that the small, character-driven sensibility meshes with PJ's reputation as the \"Kiwi King of Splatter\", and if Jackson's sensitivity to a story about two mad girls and their interior lives is by way of a chance to have giant clay people with swords kill people, or for his antiheroines to be menaced by Orson Welles in _The Third Man_.\n\nWe have also watched _Schindler's List_ on DVD. Recent conversations have mentioned that _Shoah_ is the superior Holocaust film. Of this I am certain: _Shoah_ is a documentary, and the thing that takes one right out of _Schindler's_-as-Holocaust is its moments of Spielbergian sentimentality. The last scene, where Schindler's reaction to the gratitude of \"his\" Jews is to freak out over how many more he could have saved by selling his car or his Nazi pin, is a total acting moment for Neeson, and only underscores that he is an actor given pithy lines by screenwriter Steven Zaillian, that this is a drama and that the lengthy sequence of the Schindler Jews returning (along with the members of the cast who played them) perhaps tries for a resonance and authority that the movie hasn't really earned."
    extended: "\n\nIt's frustrating that some viewers, because of the subject matter, find it unseemly to consider _Schindler's List_ as a movie -- it's much more polite to consider it an artifact of Holocaust memorial that is beyond reproach or discussion. I am not certain that it is an \"important\" film -- it is perhaps the most ignored movie in history, in the sense that we think of it as unimpeachable. I am also not certain that it's Spielberg's best film, although it probably ties for first place with _A.I._.\n\nWhat's most surprising to me is that I didn't remember the film's depiction of its Nazi villains to be so even-handed and human. Apart from Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), who is a likable but unforgivable sadist, generally the Nazis are bureaucrats and plutocrats who are more worried about their own position and workload than in human lives. They are depicted as amoral, which is even more chilling for the notion that (e.g.) Ben Kingsley could be erased from the face of the earth because he doesn't have his work card in his pocket.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one to notice, but it's interesting that in Spielberg's movies, the antagonist is rarely _evil_ in the Darth Vader sense, but always amoral and ruthless. This applies both to the monsters, like Jaws or the T-Rex in _Jurassic Park_, and to humans like Belloq (in _Raiders_) and the Max von Sydow character in _Minority Report_. A surprising lot of Spielberg movies are about how self-serving, powerful men can use/abuse even more powerful systems to destroy lives. In his best films, the characters never live happily ever after, even though the director has a gift for finding endings that leave you not questioning the existence of God (much). In fact, Spielberg's most unsatisfying endings -- such as in _Saving Private Ryan_ or _Minority Report_ -- are the ones where a sentimental coda is tacked onto a bleak, but otherwise perfect, ending.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at: when you consider _Schindler's List_ as a movie and not as a trope of the Holocaust itself, it becomes noticeable that _all_ Spielberg films tell this same story; what makes _Schindler's_ exceptional is that while it is about a noble act, it is fully aware of the insanity that necessitated it."

    title: "Free Harvard!!!"

While I wouldn't start expecting a poor but brilliant African-American kid from the South Side of Chicago to come from nowhere, get into Harvard and end up on the fast track to run a major corporation or become President (although that would kick some ass), it makes a statement against the disenfranchisement of, well, everyone who isn't connected to the East Coast intelligentsia.\n\nHarvard is saying, essentially, that you are not your parents' income bracket. This is in many ways a pleasant fiction, but it also gives lower-income kids more power to affect their own future. This is a good thing.\n\nThere will still be, and always will be, an argument to be made that the Ivy League is elitist in the sense that you have a 100% better chance to get in if your dad is named George Bush than if he's called Jorge Nunez or Usama al-Halawi[1], and no admissions or aid reforms is going to create a totally equitable system.\n\nBut this is the kind of progressiveness we can ask for in America, and we should smile and nod and go back to looking for work in the fast food industry.[2]"
    extended: "fn1. I don't mean to imply that the kids of anyone by those names is unfit for Harvard, or that Hispanic-Americans or Arab-Americans are likewise, only that historically, Anglos from aristocratic American families have the edge in admissions to Harvard and the other Ivies. I'm sure that if Jorge Nunez is a partner in a major Mexican law firm, or if Usama al-Halawi is a Saudi oil tycoon, their kids have _so_ much more of a shot at getting into Harvard than I do.\n\nfn2. Remember: steady leadership in times of change."

    description: "In which a slogan is deconstructed."

The ad is all about the \"challenges\" America faced _at the start_ of the Dubya presidency, capped by the slogan \"Steady Leadership in Times of Change.\"\n\nPerhaps this is best understood via the Manning Theorem of Quotage, usually applied on movie posters and yet quite germane to this shit. You see, Bush could be saying that his administration has provided \"steady leadership in times of change.\" But as any film critic can tell you, sometimes these statements aren't the whole truth. In the same way that \"Great god, this movie sucked!\" can turn into \"Great!!!\", perhaps what the Bushies mean to say is:\n\nbq. Steady Leadership...In Times Of Change\n\nWhere the ellipsis is standing in for:\n\nbq. Steady Leadership Is What You Need In Times Of Change.\n\nAnd perhaps there's another phrase that's been deleted:\n\nbq. Steady Leadership Is What You Need In Times Of Change, Not An Ongoing Sideshow Of Corporate Sell-Out And Unilateralist Stupidity\n\nOr perhaps there is a hidden message in the slogan. Perhaps, if we take the first letters of the words, they form a new and different acronym:\n\nbq. S.L.I.T.O.C.\n\nWhich, as far as we know, could stand for:\n\nbq. So long, idiots! Terrorism! Oil! Capitalism!\n\nOr perhaps the acronym is backwards:\n\nbq.

    body: "Blogging from the toilet: that's what the information superhighway is all about. I'm testing <a href=\"http://mobilemt.sourceforge.net/src/\">mobileMT</a>, a new PHP-based WAP interface for Movable Type, which so far seems to be working quite well. This will allow me to post to the site from my phone, a process which (as now) will undoubtedly involve me coming home and copiously re-editing everything in \"ecto\":http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/, which perhaps defeats the purpose.\n \nThis shall not distract us, however, from our more important goal: pancakes.\n\nh2. Later On\n\nI've been thinking about the possible uses of this new power to update from anywhere, and it occurs to me to wonder: _why??_\n\nThrough the miracle of T9 text entry, I can blog on my phone without too much pain, but it's still something good mostly for short bursts of (hopefully coherent) prose, without the usual benefits of linkage, pretty pictures, -proofreading- and access to a web browser to check my sources. In other words, perhaps a cellphone interface is just not compatible with my style of working.\n\nThat said, I am glad that I have this capability. I do have this idea that I could reverse-engineer this PHP implementation of the Movable Type API to give myself the ability to edit entries to my non-MT-based databases using Ecto. That would, like, be cool.\n\nFurther, I can always do what I did this morning and do a minimal post via my phone, which I can then flesh out later by my usual methods. This would be useful if, for example, there was an armed revolt in Daley Plaza. I could post to the blog\n\nbq. OMFG they just pulled out guns and I'm outta here!!!!\n\nand then later expand it to say\n\nbq. OMFG the \"Chicago Tribune\":http://www.chicagotribune.com/ is reporting on the \"armed revolt where I almost got FUCKING KILLED\":/ and that Generalissimo Daley has been winged, but not killed. And now, pancakes.\n\nThat's the Practical way: first the info, then the better info and pancakes."

    title: "Regarding Sue"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which a Survivor contestant cries sexual humiliation, which to some sounds suspiciously like \"wolf!!\""
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/susan_hawk.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"128\" alt=\"susan_hawk\" style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #999; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px\" />*What happened last week on _Survivor: All-Stars_:* Richard Hatch, the game's first winner, an openly gay man known for parading around camp (and even playing Immunity Challenges) naked, accidentally/on purpose(?) brushed his bathing suit area against that of Susan Hawk, the mouthy Midwestern trucker who was part of his alliance in the first season, and gave the famous \"snake and rat\" speech in the last episode. Both were on a tricky set of balance beams,  going opposite directions, with Sue standing at an intersection. They were playing for opposite teams.\n\n*What happened this week:* Sue wakes up the next day feeling very, very violated having (apparently) dreamed/immediately thought of Richard Hatch's big gay cock. She carries this around with her all day, all but withdrawing mentally from her tribe, Chapera, and the game.\n\nLater, at the Reward Challenge, Jeff Probst opens the topic for discussion while they have all 12 players present, and Sue freaks out, screaming at Jeff and eventually announcing that she has to leave the game. A boat is called, and Sue is gone. They play for a food reward, the Mogo Mogo tribe wins and everyone goes home.\n\nThe next day at the Chapera camp, Rob Mariano (the tribe's Michael Corleone-wannabe leader) and Big Tom Buchanan (the colorful goat farmer who frequently butted heads with Sue) sang \"Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead\" and did a funny dance. Rupert, the other male on Chapera, laughed. The women shake their heads at the insensitivity of the men, even as they too aren't totally sure where they stand with regard to Sue's decision.\n\nThey get a note in their mailbox informing them that because Sue quit the show/game, the Immunity Challenge has been cancelled and nobody will be voted out this episode.[1] The show ends with Chapera eating rice and Rob being his typical, vaguely misogynist self.\n\n*What happens next:* Between having to sit next to (or in the same room with) Richard Hatch and having her tribe sing \"Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead\" after she quit, oh my God, Susan Hawk is going to be _awful_ at the reunion show. This could very well be an even more divisive _Survivor_ moment than last year's show where previous losers got to re-enter the game, because that was infuriating/exhilarating on an entirely bureaucratic level.\n\nThe Survivors spent tonight's show shifting between cynicism, sadness, compassion, joy, more cynicism -- all over a situation that didn't seem like a big deal when it happened (both to the viewers at home, and apparently to Sue and Rich's fellow players and the host), and now reportedly involves a potential lawsuit and CBS treading on eggshells over how to present this on TV post-Nipplegate.\n\nThe facts everyone is dealing with here:\n\n* Sue and Rich were teammates on the original _Survivor_, where he got his reputation for nudism around camp.\n* Rich is openly gay and in a committed relationship (and currently trying to get married to his partner), and Sue is happily married.\n* When It happened, Sue seemed to think it was gross, but was generally okay with it and went back to her tribe's platform.\n* The next day, she mentally checked out of the game in the sense that she spent lots of time brooding on what happened, and not a lot of time arguing with Big Tom, which struck the other members of Chapera as rather unusual.\n* Apparently, before quitting at the Reward Challenge, Sue made a(n offhand) comment to Rupert that she was going to sue somebody (presumably Rich) for ten million dollars.\n\nThe way it broke down on the show is that the male contestants are suspicious of her motives for leaving, and the female ones are sympathetic, compassionate and suspicious. Kathy (one of my favorite Survivors ever) said that she resented Sue lashing out and (I paraphrase) bringing everyone into her zone of hate. Rob broke down the possibilities even before she left:\n\n# Sue sincerely felt violated.\n# Sue is looking to use this as a ploy to get her farther in the current _Survivor_ game. (This option, I think, we can rule out.)\n# Sue is looking to use this situation to sue Richard and/or CBS for all they're worth, which is a hell of a lot more than the \$1 million she'd win by starving for another three weeks.\n\nWhat makes this such a tricky thing to have happened, let alone to be showing on TV, is simply that nobody has enough information to make judgements. We, the viewers, certainly don't: while we have a taste for what Rich Hatch and Sue Hawk are like from having seen them on two _Survivor_ series, we can't really know what goes on inside their heads.\n\nFrom what we've seen on the series and in interviews, I can easily presume that Rich (being gay and at least somewhat narcissistic, honestly thought that it was embarrassing, but no moreso than (e.g.) eating insects on national television. Especially given that they know and genially dislike each other -- the sexual component may have crossed his mind, but it's something that he may have thought Sue wouldn't take so personally considering that, well, it's _Hatch_ for chrissakes.\n\nI can also presume that Sue, who is a passionate woman known for  letting things simmer until they explode (see also her friendship with Kelly turning into utter hatred over three episodes in season one), really was shaken by waking up to a rememberance of a big gay cock. I mean, who wouldn't be disturbed by that?\n\nWhat's weird is that even the people on the show -- who know both of these people fairly well in the real world and lived with them on the island for at least two weeks -- don't seem to know what to make of this. There's an aspect that just doesn't feel so cut and dried, and it can't be chalked up to the insensitivity of some alpha males, or the atmosphere of distrust that surrounds Survivors.\n\nThis isn't a rape victim who some white men are saying shouldn't have been walking around with cleavage hanging out. This is a smart, powerful woman dealing with a man they all know fairly well, who had ample opportunities to call foul. In fact, Sue could have made a very strong case to have Richard ejected right then and there under the game rules, which forbid contestants from touching another person inappropriately.\n\n_But_ she didn't say anything until the next day, and (according to Rupert) made comments about a lawsuit before she left.[2] So it's a huge mess that even now hasn't totally been cleaned up.\n\nh2. Or has it???\n\nSue and Rich appeared together on the Early Show, and \"apparently they're past it.\":http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/04/earlyshow/series/survivor/main604082.shtml No lawsuit, and she doesn't seem to hate him any more or less than she did since, like, the day she met him. She just didn't want to touch the dirty rat's snake, or something like that."

    title: "Falafel ball!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which falafel leads to lameness, which leads to Lego sex games, which leads to more falafel."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/falafel.jpg\" height=\"169\" width=\"175\" alt=\"falafel\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; border: 1px solid #999;\" />Ah, falafel: the vegetarian food everyone can agree on, offensive to no one except the carb counters, so yummy that we carnivores can forgive that nothing died to fill our stomachs. It is helpful to consider that falafel is fried, which may explain part of its universal appeal, as there are certain segments of the population that would eat boot leather if it were battered, fried and imbued with savory spices.\n\nIt would also have been helpful for me to remember how many falafel balls could be made with a single box of falafel mix; I find myself with way too much falafel goodness to eat in a single sitting. Especially being so brilliant as to have forgotten veggies or any kind of sauce.\n\nMy schemes now turn toward some kind of falafel-based event, where falafel and cheap wine would be served not least because both can be procured cheaply at Trader Joe's. We could watch movies and play with Legos.\n\nIn fact, we could play sex games with Legos. I don't really know how such a thing would work, but there really needs to be an intellectual (read: nerdy) alternative to Spin the Bottle, as a response to the free and enjoyable copulation of prettier, dumber, cooler people. Yes -- in protest, we will take off all our clothes and play with Legos, and when we are all thoroughly embarrassed and have learned absolutely nothing except that we hate each other -- me especially -- then we can watch William Shatner overact in Esperanto.\n\nWe could also, taking another route, have timed trials at making a reasonably accurate Lego version of Godzilla. The point is that we here have the most basic ingredients for fun that don't involve alcohol, sex or actual fun. We have falafel, Legos and really awful cult movies. Here at Practicalmadness, we advocate having a good time that you can never tell anyone about at work, not because it's debauched and decadent, but because it's so fucking lame. Lameness = yay.\n\nLess talk. Talk not now -- falafel now. Mmm, falafel."

    title: "The Pissing on the Christ"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we discuss The Movie."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/piss_christ.jpg\" height=\"230\" width=\"150\" alt=\"piss_christ\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px\" />So we're sitting in class, trying really hard not to talk about _The Godfather_, which we are watching in two parts over two weeks, the first of which was tonight. And someone asks the 64,000 shekel question:\n\nbq. Like, what did you think of _The Passion of the Christ_?\n\nHoo boy.\n\nIs it anti-Semitic? Yes, apparently...and no. Maybe. We don't know. We desperately want to believe, and yes, do believe that Mel Gibson is not an anti-Semite, but he has made an anti-Semitic film. In fact, this film is a hate crime, in the same way that a kid playing around with a Smith &#38; Wesson revolver who accidentally shoots somebody has committed a crime of passion.\n\nMy own thoughts on the matter: there is hate here, but it's likely entirely self-directed (i.e., Gibson's desire to torture, victimize and immolate himself). And if there are crimes, they're entirely cinematic. So to answer the question, the film is not anti-Semitic in the way that you're thinking it's anti-Semitic -- the first draft of the screenplay was not penned by Reinhard Heydrich, and the guys from _Law and Order_ don't go around pegging the murder of Our Lord Jesus Christ on the Jews collectively as a race, religion or health club. It would seem that it makes vague allusions to some political tensions between the mainstream (and Rome-approved) Jewish clerics and Jesus's revolutionary sect, and that if there are any regular Jews (Jewish regulars?) calling for Caviezel's head, it's politically motivated.\n\nWhat this whole debate makes me think about is the whole question of deicide, and further the whole notion of Christ as deity. Christianity, Judaism and Islam all believe in God/Jehovah/Allah, who is the one and only deity. But Christianity and Islam both have prophets who have been elevated to godlike status, despite the Old Testament commandments about false idols, graven images and gods before God.\n\nMy point is not that Jesus was a piker, but rather that it would seem that a lot of Christian beliefs just seem a little bit off. Like the whole \"Jesus saves\" business -- no, idiot, Jesus _saved_. The whole point of Christ is that he is both fully human and fully divine, who offered himself as a sacrifice to make it possible for us sinners to reconcile with heaven. He is not:\n\n* A subdeity, or full deity, who comes down to intervene in shit. He is Christ -- his job is done, now it's humanity's turn.\n* A reason to persecute, go to war or propose constitutional amendments protecting marriage. He is Christ, and you'd think the idea of self-sacrifice would be in total opposition to using religion to persecute others.\n* A character played by Jim Caviezel, Willem Dafoe, Jeffrey Hunter, Jeremy Sisto or Graham Chapman. He is Christ, who was Jesus of Nazareth, a historical figure. Any depiction of him is inherently wrong (or as we like to say in art school, hyperreal) because, like, _it's not really him_.\n* A white male who speaks English. (Probably. If you can find any evidence that there were English-speaking, fair-skinned Anglos in Judea in the 1st Century, please e-mail it to someone who cares.)\n\nMy favorite Jesus movie? Commence flaming me now, but it's _The Last Temptation of Christ_. It's the one that best navigates the slippery slopes between the burden of divinity and Jesus's humanity, and between Jesus as religious messiah and revolutionary leader. The line that really gets me (other than a guy saying that Mary Magdelene should die in a Bronx accent):\n\nbq. You think God belongs only to you?...God is not an Israelite!\n\nIf there is a God, he is something that cannot, and should not, live totally within our notions of a guy in flowing white robes sitting in the clouds and making sure that you pass your drug test, or win the lotto, or don't die in that car crash you're about to have. This is not to say that God or Jesus are not compassionate -- He/they _are_ compassion embodied, infinite and larger than any thousands of human lives.\n\nMy point with regard to _The Passion_, and the debate surrounding the film, is that the physical suffering is at once absolutely not and absolutely the point, depending on how you look at Jesus. Mel Gibson's motivation for starting this project was that he was contemplating suicide, and that thinking about the incredible sacrifice of Christ saved him, and filled him with a desire to tell the story.\n\nIf your focus is on Jesus's teachings and his importance as a political figure -- and the charges that the Jews committed murder, or worse, deicide -- the movie will seem very, very wrong. I think, however, that the purpose of the movie is entirely visceral, which helps explain the insistence on Aramaic and Latin instead of English. There is so much wrong with the movie historically that to have the actors speak the languages is a superficial gesture. If this were a movie with an intellectual agenda, it would be natural to have the actors -- all fine English-speaking actors -- read English dialogue.\n\nI do not think Gibson is trying to preach. I think that the violence, and the horror that it evokes in him, is profound to Mel Gibson. It's a piece of the sublime, totally unexplainable in words. It's not a documentary, but it is a meditation on the spirituality of violence and pain, which taps into something deep and primal in all of us.\n\nI think most people would not totally sympathize with Gibson's need for Christlike self-sacrifice, or to express himself by getting beaten up on film. But that's not what a lot of the discussions are talking about -- we're so hung up on the political and dogmatic side that we might be missing the true core of the movie.\n\nOf course, you're probably thinking I'm just a smart-ass heathen to be talking about Our Savior that way, or to take _The Passion of the Christ_ as anything but what you want it to be. \n\nIn the immortal words of William Shatner, get a life."

    description: "In which we hack Hotmail."
    body: "So I'm bombing around in some old files on my hard drive, and what should I discover but...Sophie!\n\nNo, not the cat or Roald Dahl's daughter who is like a plus-size lingerie model or something -- Sophie was a research project of mine last year where I tried to write a PHP script to access Hotmail. I named it after our cat who was about as refined as my coding, and only slightly better-behaved than Hotmail.\n\nThe trick to accessing Hotmail, as it turns out, is to treat it like a WebDAV server, and tell it that you're _really_ Outlook Express. The rest is just an endless series of redirects and XML parsing. I fired it up last night, and it works better than I remembered.\n\nMy work was based on an open-source project called \"Hail\":http://sourceforge.net/projects/hail/, which does the same thing as Sophie, only better and tidier. In fact, when I decided to play around last night with making a new (ad-free!) graphical front-end for Hotmail, I did so using the Hail class rather than my own script, just because, well...I'm not a _total_ masochist, and my version kinda sucks.\n\nOne advantage to the whole thing, though, was that it provided a hugely enlightening foray into the HTTP communications standard upon which the Web is based, and I'm already thinking ahead to how I can (for example) use some of the technology from Hail and Sophie to enhance Practical.\n\nNow, if only I saved a copy of my \"TrackBack\":http://movabletype.org/ implementation..."

    title: "It's the free speech, stupid"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I stick up for Sean Penn and start wondering why I leave comments turned on."
    body: "I generally try to refrain from commenting on the comments posted to the site, but I'm sorry, I feel I must step in and address this one, which was left on \"my original reaction to the Oscar nominations\":http://practicalmadness.com/m/a/2004/01/regarding_the_oscars:\n\nbq. I loved the Oscars except for the unintelligent way Sean Penn spoke.  I am a US citizen and I respect my government and if I don't like what is being done, I voice my opinion in places I should.   The night of the academies is not the place and it creates a bad taste for you to let that occur. Sean also feels free to send messages to Iraq running down our government. I have no respect for him, he should live in Iraq and see what their goverment is like. It is very sad for you to allow this on the Oscars night. I disliked everything Clinton stood for, but I would never show disrespect like this, as he our President and there used to be respect in this country. Some of the hollywood clan used to be people to look up to, now they are an embarrassment and are tearing down our establishment and teaching children to show disrespect. We have freedom of speech and that is privilege and I really don't care what they think politically, but some are carrying this too far.   God Bless A!\nMerica!!!\n\nFor one thing, you really ought to have left this comment on \"this post\":http://practicalmadness.com/m/a/2004/03/oscarvations, which comments on the Oscar _winners and show_, as opposed to the nominations. But you know, whatever.\n\nMy real problem is this idea that people should be respectful to the President on awards shows, and especially the notion that Sean Penn was in any way unintelligent. I thought that given the man's history of political action (e.g., going to Iraq before the war), to make a snide remark about what may turn out to be the single biggest lie ever peddled by an American president was remarkably subdued and respectful.\n\nThat is to say, _of course_ it wasn't respectful, but it wasn't an unshaven Minnesotan screaming about a fictitious war less than a week after American troops went into combat. And respectful or not, these things need to be said. Listen to me very carefully: _there were no WMDs._ We were sold a bill of goods that included images of Iraqi nukes showering down on Anytown USA, only to find that those nukes do not, did not and could not exist. The UN inspections and embargos _worked_.\n\nIf the government could prove that there were WMDs in a country that we've controlled for almost a year, don't you think they would have? When hunting down a lie, you should always look for inconsistency, and the Administration and Republican Party seem to have a new explanation or scapegoat for the WMD thing every week.\n\nLook, the moment we start to second-guess our right to freedom of speech is the moment we lose it. It is not polite or in keeping with the spirit of excess and jubilation that surrounds the Academy Awards to use them as a political platform. _However_, if the man has something to say, let him say it. Then we can think ill of him, or cheer him on, or whatever, but if we refuse to let Sean Penn (or Michael Moore, or whoever) speak or prevent him from speaking then the discussion has ended before it's started. No civilization can survive if it lacks the freedom to question itself.\n\nI leave you from this quote from Walter Lippmann:\n\nbq. There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the means by which to detect lies."

Actually, my true thoughts are a little more intense, but after all...well, the five second delay.\n\nI seriously could not have predicted that _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ would sweep all eleven of its categories. I mean, I know Hollywood loves these movies, but this is a little bit crazy. Not that I'm complaining, although it would have been nice to see _Master and Commander_ pick up another statue or two.\n\nSofia Coppola now has an Academy Award. My last shred of faith in the American film industry is now gone.\n\nObserved: Fran Walsh is kinda cute. Jennifer Garner = hot. Also, I think Martin Scorsese can stop making movies now -- he has truly found his calling as spokesauteur for the American Express card.\n\nh2. Tha game\n\nAfter an extremely competitive Oscars Game, *Ellen Jaramillo* managed a respectable 65 point lead over your humble narrator, securing the people's ovation and fame forever as this year's winner. She also secures a \$25 American Express giftcard, \$10 in online spending cash and a small token of my admiration, probably involving Legos.\n\nJust behind my own score of 790 points was Paul Jarnagin, our second runner-up with a scary 710. While I had originally planned to not award a first prize if I came in second, I think we can rustle up some Legos for Mr. Jarnagin as well.\n\nCongratulations, and thanks to everyone for playing."

    title: "Hey, there's a Bergman screening!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we relay an announcement."
    body: "Attention Chicago-area college students who dig Bergman movies:\n\nbq. Shot on video for Swedish Television, SARABAND is a sequel to Bergman&#8217;s acclaimed 1973 work SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE.  Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson reprise their roles as Marianne and Johann, now seen thirty years after their divorce.\n\nbq. The 85-year-old Bergman has declared that this will be his final film.  He has so far refused to transfer SARABAND to 35mm or to authorize its theatrical release.  The film will be presented at the Film Center on digital video, in Swedish with English subtitles.\n\nbq. Pia Ehrnvall, producer of SARABAND, and Torbj&#246;rn Ehrnvall, its assistant director, will be present for audience discussion.  For making this presentation possible, the Film Center thanks the Ehrnvalls, Peter Berggren, Kerstin Lane, Scandinavian Airlines, and The General Consulate of Chicago.\n\nbq. This private screening, the first outside of Europe, is open to college students and faculty only.  Admission is free.  Tickets will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis at the Gene Siskel Film Center box office starting at 9:30 am on the day of the screening, March 4.   A current college photo-ID card must be presented at both the box-office and at the theater door for admittance, and only one ticket will be issued per person.\n\nbq. The Gene Siskel Film Center is located at 164 N. State Street, between Lake and Randolph.  For further information, please call 312-846-2600."

    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/david_camera.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"128\" alt=\"david_camera\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px; border: 1px solid #999\" />What follows is assorted weirdness for your enjoyment on this idle Tuesday.\n\nh2. We love the subs!!!\n\nActually, no, we're not that crazy about the Quiznos Subs, no matter what the spongmonkeys may have to say on the matter. However, we have just parlayed a long-expired coupon for \$2 off admission to an exhibition at a Birmingham museum that is no longer running into a buck off a mesquite chicken sub. I think we can deal.\n\nh2. Bookses\n\nI know you were dying to know, but so overcome by my good looks, fabulous wealth and dare I say _dangerous_ sexual energy that you hesitated to ask, so I will tell you: O'Reilly's _MySQL Pocket Reference_ is worthless. Well, perhaps not worthless, but if you write SQL queries with any frequency at all, I'd think you'd have internalized this stuff, and what you _really_ need in a desk reference is something a little more in-depth.\n\nAlso: this first edition of a pocket-sized MySQL reference from O'Reilly covers only version 4.0 of the open-source database engine. That's well and good, especially if you're running your own server, but there are many of us in web-land still stuck on version 3.23 or earlier. I think _Managing and Using MySQL_, the fatter, way more expensive sibling to this book, has some information on backwards compatibility with the older software. But then, so does the free, online documentation at \"MySQL.com\":http://www.mysql.com/.\n\nOur latest acquisitions from \"First Cut Books\":http://www.firstcutbooks.com/ are way more fun. There's the McSweeneys-published _Jokes Told In Heaven About Babies_ (Lucy Thomas), which is (a) extremely short and (b) beautiful, if a little frustrating on first read. Apparently it collects some of Thomas's short writings from _Timothy McSweeney's Online Heroin Orgy_, which explains the brevity and disjointed nature of the collection. Like many McSweeneys publications, _J.T.I.H.A.B._ is a masterfully made print object, complete with hand-drawn images of piers and beautifully-set type.\n\nAlso: Italo Calvino's _Invisible Cities_. I have not yet managed to finish _If on a winter's night a traveler_, for being a youngish American who grew up in the 80s and 90s and thus possessed of a freakishly short attention span, the book's conceit of ten or so novels that start, get going and then are rudely interrupted at a moment of suspense is interesting, but a little difficult to slog through if you're reading the book in fits and starts during coffee breaks at work.[1] Also: I'm a filmmaker; breaking off a story at what's basically the start of Act II, while thematically brilliant, just sticks in my craw.\n\nI have high hopes, though, for this book; in it Marco Polo describes some impossible cities to Kublai Khan that he claims to have seen on his travels. Yay.\n\nOf course, both books came wrapped in \"that fabulous house packaging\":http://practicalmadness.com/2003/12/the_package.\n\nh2. The futility of advertising\n\nI have decided that if the advertising on this page cannot feature spongmonkeys, I will have no advertising at all. Yep. That's why the Google banner is gone. No spongmonkeys, no banner.\n\nYeah, right. I'm still having problems getting the ads-and-links column to play nice with the rest of the page, and I was starting to think that the content area of the page (e.g., the white-not-green part) was a bit too cluttered anyway. So by popular demand of nobody in particular, we're going back to the old format. Woo-hoo. I kick ass.\n\nWhile I think there's a clause in the Google AdSense user agreement that prohibits me from mentioning how much money I'm making from these banners (which still run on most other pages, and will return soon to the homepage), let's just say that it's very slightly up from last year's dollars-per-day figures, and that I'll only have to whore myself on East Division Street for _four_ days a week to cover my expenses on this site.\n\nThanks, Dear Readers, for all your help."
    extended: "fn1. Also, the prose is a little awkward in spots, which may be an unfortunate artifact of the translation from Italian to English; it has that quality of using either too many words or not enough in its descriptions. Granted, I can't think of how one could have improved the flow of the translation without in some way hurting Calvino's work -- I certainly wouldn't be the translator who would dare to rewrite Italo Calvino to make him more palatable to MTV-addled Americans -- but that is something that may be a source of frustration, if you're trying to jump from Dave Eggers to Calvino in a single weekend."

At the risk of sounding inattentive to the plight of Chicago's less fortunate, I've heard the fucking speech so many fucking times I could pick up around the second verse and turn it into a Busby Berkeley number.\n\nIt goes like this:\n\nbq. Hey [man/big guy], can I-- can I just talk to you for a sec? [Hell/Damn/Shit/Lawd], I just wanna axe you a question. [Blah blah blah car was _IMpounded_ yada yada I have to go to Naperville! and blah blah need sixty dollars to get on a Greyhound blah.]\n\nI'd be more willing to consider these stories on their individual merits if I hadn't heard the same one with so little variation so many times, so well-practiced and all within a block or two of the river. Tonight I did get a rare one: \"I was just let out of the pen'tentiary six days ago...\"\n\nOn Michigan Avenue you can see, side by side, sickening material excess and really unsettling desperation -- hustling going on in front of Burberry and Prada.

    description: "In which IE + Javascript = pain."
    body: "So today I made some further improvements to the query form on \"Thousand Words\":/photos/, which now allows you to narrow a search by date as well as by category. Which is nice, made moreso by a bit of JavaScript trickery that allows you to select said dates by clicking on a calendar, rather than typing them in. Yay me.\n\nOf course, none of this works in Internet Explorer for Windows, and I'm a little afraid to try it out in Internet Explorer for Mac. This is made all the more frustrating because, well, it _should_ work in IE Windows. I'm not totally sure where the bug in my scripting code is, and as far as I know I'm not using any objects or methods or whatever that aren't supported by IE.\n\nI already spent a few hours building it this morning, and I still have some homework, so I just say screw it. I'll try to make the search engine accessible to IE users in the next day or so, but right now why don't you take this perfect opportunity to try out \"Firefox\":http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/? Think of it as the Internet Explorer that Microsoft won't let you have for another 2-??? years until Longhorn comes out.\n\nEspecially since two travel sites I've tried where a popup calendar might be, y'know, useful also seem to be incompatible with IE for Windows in this way."

    title: "Bank Proliferation"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I celebrate the latest design trends in branch banks, while expressing my disgust at the apparent racism of Citibank."
    body: "I was watching a History Channel doc the other day about the history of the U.S. banking industry, that included a brief corporography of Bank of America, the nation's first large-scale branch bank. Also mentioned: the design of bank structures, specifically how the neoclassical architecture employed by banks up to and through the 20th century was meant to symbolize strength and stability -- that banks look a certain way so as to reinforce the people's faith in their financial system.\n\nWhere these two stories come together is evident here in Chicago, where Bank of America -- which opened its first Chicago branch about 18 months ago -- is in the middle of a truly staggering expansion. They currently have prime locations in the Loop and in every major Chicago neighborhood, with new ones opening all the time. And it's not just them: Washington Mutual, famous mostly for not charging customers of other banks to use their ATMs[1], is opening tons of locations, while TCF (which heretofore has operated mostly out of Jewel supermarkets) and LaSalle (which has gotten an image makeover after being bought out by ABN AMRO) are also expanding their presence in the city.\n\nIt's remarkable that the banking industry in Chicago has gotten so competitive so quickly -- when I came here five years ago, the only really large banks were Citibank and First Chicago (now going by the name of their parent company, Bank One), with LaSalle, MidAmerica and North Community operating as smaller local alternatives. But even more amazing than the variety is that many of the new branch banks, especially the ones opened by B. of A. and WaMu, don't look like traditional banks and aren't opening in spaces that you'd associate with a bank.\n\nThe B. of A. branch I go to most often, at Washington and Dearborn, used to be a Hallmark greeting card store. I passed one at Clark and Fullerton today that used to be a Gap, and still looks enough like a Gap that I should have snapped a picture and submitted it to \"NotFoolingAnybody.com\":http://notfoolinganybody.com/. The WaMu branches are storefronts so nestled in with the other storefronts that you really do have to look twice to realize that they're banks.\n\nThe big part of this is the layout and decor. WaMu's interiors are bright and colorful -- it would seem that they're aiming for younger customers by filling their space with a totally different vibe than the more officious, dare I say intimidating feel of (e.g.) Citibank.\n\nBank of America, meanwhile, has earned my love and respect by adopting an inviting, wide open floor plan that, unlike most Chicago banks, _has no obstacles between the front door and the teller counter_. In fact, unlike Citibank and WaMu, B.o.A.'s ATM machine is not even accessible from the lobby, giving one the impression that they actually _want_ you to do your banking with a human being.\n\nWhat's more, they're friendly. I have yet to go into a B.o.A. branch in Chicago where they don't greet you at the door, and tell to have a good one on your way out.\n\nThis is fantastic. This completely obliterates one's notions of what banking feels like. This is nothing like my former bank, Citibank, where the only white male behind the teller counter is relegated only to business accounts. These new banks actually try to create the impression not only that they want your business, but tacitly acknowledge that there is more to getting it than just putting out a shingle and handing you a debit card.\n\nh2. Regarding banks and race-awareness\n\nThe comment about the tellers at Citibank is an admittedly race-aware statement. At the time I was there, the other tellers were Latina women generally dressed in casual clothes, with a dark-skinned, presumably Indian or Pakistani, man wearning a golf shirt supervising them. The one visible white person in a customer service position for a company run exclusively by white people was handling only business clients. I do not mean to suggest that the Latinas were necessarily providing inferior service -- trust me, being from Alabama I'm very well aware of the white man's capacity for ineptitude.\n\nBut in Chicago, a city where the service workers -- Starbucks notwithstanding -- are all black or Hispanic with the occasional Asian or Polish caucasian thrown in, what does it say when _Citibank_ -- the ultimate Eastern establishment bank, an institution so powerful that they are the only Chicago consumer bank to not even hint that they offer free checking -- not only has a separate-but-equal thing going on with whites and hispanics, consumers and business, but doesn't even have their tellers at a Loop branch wear ties?\n\nThe thing is that I haven't yet had reason to doubt the professionalism of the staff at my Bank of America branch, where the staff is also mostly non-white, which is the case at a lot of Chicago banks. In fact, to see a blond-haired white person behind the counter in any bank is only slightly unusual, but goes from unusual to infuriating when they're sitting under a sign that says CITIBUSINESS.\n\nI wonder, does he get paid more to be the CitiBusiness teller? You can be sure that the clients he deals with generally have much larger, more lucrative relationships with the company than the average consumer. I wonder, if those business customers give Citibank an extra few grand, can they have blowjobs in the back office from an Anglo woman from corporate?\n\nSo it's not the fact of non-whites serving customers that I mind, just the idea that Citibank associates a higher tier of service with whiteness. Granted, this is just one branch of a massive corporation, and I'm sure there are non-male, non-white CitiBusiness tellers at _some_ Citibank branch somewhere. But at _this_ branch, where you have a bunch of minorities hustling to serve everyday customers while a blonde white guy just sits there earning the same or better money to just wait for these phantom business customers is a little disgusting."

The biggest changes: a new bevelled look to the rough stripeys, and the addition of a logo and tagline at the top of the page. This looks cool, and I like it conceptually, as my use of rough, handmade-esque lines and broken-typewriter fonts has always been intended as a spoof on the freakishly linear designs at other sites.\n* I finally solved my homepage dilemma: the links are staying where they are, and are now floated to the right so that stuff wraps around them at the bottom. I'm still undecided w/r/t the left side -- I'm thinking pretty pictures.\n* \"Thousand Words\":/photos/ now includes some new photos, more categories and an improved interface for browsing the collection, chock full of DHTML-enabled hand-holding. If you use it enough, you forget how annoying all that JavaScript is. Also, the thumbnail frame thing has been changed: it's gone back to a slick-lookin' thing with a bevel and drop shadow. Yay \"Eye Candy\":http://www.alienskin.com/.\n* Reader Services (user registration and login for such features as the Oscars Game) has been slightly improved; the logging-in functions are now a little more generalized, which should enable me to set up new Services quite easily and quickly. Also: some of my homemade site-management appliances now use RS for security, and are set up to accept only my own Reader ID.[2] This will enable such fun things as the Wireless Oscars Game (mostly of interest to me), Gleaner 2.5 (mostly of interest to me) and improved Practical Webmail (mostly of interest to me and certain friends).\n* My \"chart of All-Star Survivors\":/survivor/index.php has been updated.\n* What illusions I held that Robert Altman was ever a maker of interesting, watchable films are now gone. I can see the importance of _McCabe &#38; Mrs. Miller_ on an intellectual level, but especially given the profound shittiness of the print, I hope my fellow cineastes will forgive me for deciding that this evening was better spent drinking and coding. Hell, I'm writing the paper on Chinatown anyway."

Why has he never mentioned them or linked to them?\" Hmm, gee, that's a good question -- why wouldn't I tell the whole world about the page that let's any old schmuck add photos to Thousand Words, or update the Remaindered Links, since I'm too lazy to secure such things?"

But you see, my dears, there is a _Nintendo party_ going on outside my front door, and to expand on that let's just say that I was very wrong to think no one could be more enthusiastic about _Dr. Mario_ than I am.\n\nSo having skipped breakfast, and sort of sublimated lunch into breakfast by merely having another (couple) bowls of cereal, I figure that it's high time for dinner, and what better way to celebrate Single Awareness Day, Nintendo History Month and Rendezvous Stalkers Week but to make some of my proprietary fried rice.\n\nNote that the decision to make fried rice had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I forgot to defrost any of my non-puny meat supplies earlier in the day.\n\nMy proprietary fried rice has gone through many incarnations; the earliest prototype had me trying to use mushy canned peas and carrots and too much heat while several Taiwanese students just stood by smiling knowingly.[1] Over the years, I've tried incorporating everything from bean sprouts to daikon radish, but no matter how many frighteningly pale vegetables I find it always comes back to the same basic assemblage:\n\n* Meat!!!\n* Chopped onions\n* A couple of eggs, no more, no less. No cartilage, nor bone, but only eggs. (Whipped.)\n* 2 cups cooked rice\n* Frozen peas n' carrots.\n* Soy sauce. Lots of soy sauce.\n* Optionally: sprouts, garlic, cracked pepper.\n\nAs for the cooking, I'm tired and don't care to go on a rant here. Suffice to say that \"assemblage\" is really the key word here. Make sure your meat and eggs are fully cooked before you eat them, and don't burn anything (much).\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't make like Dr. Mario and toss in a bunch of big, scary pills. You mess with that shit enough in the mornings, dude."

    title: "Son of Franken-practical"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we will, we will WAP you."
    body: "Tonight's tinkerings have centered around the \"Mobile Web version of Practical\":/wap/, which I have just redone so as to make it less, well, evil.\n\nOne big change, which I'm sure will shock the all one of you who use my WAP site, is that I've switched from WML(Wireless Markup Language) to XHTML(Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)[1]. I know, I know -- it's shocking. I can smell your pain and bewilderment from all the way over here. Like, dude, they _sell_ deodorant for that.\n\nIn \"practical\" terms (HA HA HA HA HA heh), this means that Mobile Practical will work on rather fewer handsets than it did previously, but will work better on the ones that can still see it. As for which phones and handhelds can see it, I think any phone capable of taking or receiving pictures is probably up to the job. I've been using developer info from the Sony Ericsson website to work on pages, so I'm fairly certain that any SE phone with a color screen (definitely T68 and later) has it. Most/all recent Nokia and Motorola handsets too. Not so sure about Samsung, LG or whoever else -- again, if they can receive pictures, they can probably see the site.\n\nNextel users, however, are fucked. Your desire for that damned walkie talkie thing has just blown your chance at mobile goodness.\n\nGleaner 2.0 isn't currently up there, but only while I rework it to be a little more usable. My next schemes involve a wireless interface to the Oscars Game, so that you can make picks while on the john and get your scores in real time as I update the site that evening.[2] Also, access to one's Practical e-mail (if they have such a thing), with optional SMS alerts[3] when you get new messages.\n\nAs I think of other stuff to add, I'll surely let you know. Now back to your regularly scheduled program of t.A.T.u. in the original Russian. You know, I really haven't noticed any difference yet."
    extended: "fn1.  WML is the freaky XML dialect for use specifically with mobile devices, notorious because it looks so much like normal HTML but _so_ isn't. XHTML is HTML ported to XML, which means that it looks exactly like the sludgy web code we've all been scratching out since 1995, but now there are these _rules_ and you're supposed to be able to _validate_ your code! Like, tscha!\n\np(footnote). Adding to the obscurity is that there's an XHTML dialect specifically for mobile phones, called (natch) XHTML 1.0 Mobile. The key characteristics of XHTML 1.0 Mobile are:\n\n* Still less robust than normal HTML.\n* Still more forgiving with most phones than WML.\n\nfn2. Also, it will allow me to update the winners from my chair, so that I can maintain my reputation for obsessive accuracy in the face of extreme laziness.\n\nfn3. Unless, of course, I can figure out how to do WAP push. That would rock the co--uh, sock."

    description: "In which we take potshots at _The WB's Angel_, which will soon become _The cancelled Angel_."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/angel_puppet.jpg\" height=\"144\" width=\"192\" alt=\"angel_puppet\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px\" />This season, the producers of _Angel_ have managed to turn a somewhat obscure spinoff of a now-gone cult favorite TV show into a somewhat obscure spinoff of said TV show set in an evil law firm. The possibilities were endless, but apparently in a way that's not, because \"_Angel_ has been officially not-renewed.\":http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=17011 That's to say that the current season will run its course on Wednesday nights, but that's it.\n\nThis actually makes some karmic sense, because once you've played the \"Angel and co. go work for their worst enemies\" card, what else have you got? And I mean, since they're killing off Fred in a few weeks, and bringing back Connor...oh, I'm sorry, did you want a spoiler warning?\n\nIt is said that there may be \"Angel\"-related TV movies next season, which also makes sense since it gives Joss Whedon a chance to go over budget all at once instead of piecemeal over the course of a season.\n\nGranted, that may not be a possibility once Joss spends the equivalent of three seasons' worth of money to get Sarah Michelle Gellar to _consider_ making an appearance as Buffy on the finale. Money well spent? Well, like, did you _see_ the last two seasons of _Buffy_? She turned in a better performance in _Scooby-Doo_."

    description: "In which we try to raise awareness of singledom while quite drunk."
    body: "Today is Valentine's Day, or as I like to think of it, Single Awareness Day. Or: Red Rose Preservation Day. Ultimately, I'd like to see the holiday renamed in the U.S. to honor the man or woman who invented the candy heart.\n\nWe have discovered the following amazing facts:\n\n* Chai Tea French Toast: it _can_ work.\n* If you walk far enough from State Street, there's this whole other world called the \"West Side\", so named because it's, like, west of all the cool shit. But the weird part is that if you get on a Halsted bus in the \"West\" Side, you eventually end up in areas traditionally lumped in with the North Side, like the shops at North and Clybourn, the shops on Armitage and the shops in Boys Town.\n* Just as love is not everlasting, neither are cell phone batteries. However, unlike love, batteries can be supplemented or replaced at this one shop on North for just \$50. But like love, the batteries are currently out of stock.\n* There's this thing on the Mac called \"Rendezvous\", that not only lets you mooch music from everyone in the dorm, but also _talk_ to them. Amazing, right? The thing is, I don't think anyone uses it except this one guy suffering from Jewel-ophobla. In honor of Single Awareness Day, I've spent part of my evening playing virtual Jehovah's Witness. Have you accepted savior as _your_ personal Jesus?\n* When you're talking about steel rulers with corky non-skid backing, six inches can hardly be called sufficient. I also find your suggestion of using them as a new source of clean, cheap energy to be quite laughable.\n* Speaking of bookends, now's a good time to be glad that you got one of them nice windows with the nice, big sill.\n* Vodka + Dr. Pepper Red Fusion = still tastes like Red Fusion, only 100% more intoxicating and only 30% more vile.\n* \"Having wild monkey sex\" is not the answer you anticipate when you send a text message saying \"Whazzup???\" at 11 AM.\n* Nearly any event in 20th century history, cinema or literature can in some way be related to the Gothic. When in doubt, launch into a detailed explication of the correlation between totalitarian governments, specifically Nazism, the sublimity of terror and the improbablility of horror, uh, ism.\n* _Chinatown_ is a very slow movie if you already know that John Huston fucked Faye Dunaway.\n* Sex is a subject best left to certain TV networks. MTV, HBO, Showtime: good. The History Channel, specifically a documentary narrated by Peter Coyote with insightful commentary by Hugh Hefner: bad.\n* Ryan, be careful: Some things in here don't react well to bullets.\n* Your boredom has reached its zenith when you find yourself on a Saturday night listening to the Moonlight Sonata, watching a documentary on Al Capone and making your bed at roughly the same time, such that going to the supermarket for bottled water and a box of cellentani is a major outing."

I'm still getting used to it. I went to the Aveda Institute at Clark &#38; Diversey, where they offer low-cost, highly fabulous haircuts by student stylists and their instructors. I asked for something that would have the unruly feel of my previous, Beethovenesque 'do, but shorter and more suitable for life in the real world. What kicks ass about it is that the top, with the extra length, can be slicked back for a more professional look, or left to fly for slacker cred. The possibilities are endless in a way that's not.\n\nh2. Speaking of fantasticity\n\nTonight the \"Oscars Game\":/oscars/ has nine players, and enough really strong pick sets that this year ought to be really competitive. I'm still hoping to see some more people sign up -- some regulars still haven't joined in, and I'm going to add a banner to individual site pages to catch some of my Google traffic.\n\nFor those of you wanting to partake of Practicality in the real world, I'm currently working on putting on a microcinema event here in Chicago tentatively scheduled for May 3, which would (hope hope) incorporate interactive art and, on the main stage, screenings of fun video work by local imagemakers. Details (on both how to submit work and how to come by and hang out) will be posted here when we have them.\n\nI'll be producing a music CD around May-ish, and should be finishing my long-delayed DVD project by the end of March. E-mail me or leave a comment if you're interested in ordering a copy of either. (Audio/video samples will be posted on this site.)"

The old neighborhood is more or less as we left it.\n\nTonight, for light bulbs and stuff at Home Depot, is the only time I've been anywhere near Wrightwood Avenue in seven months. Right this minute, I don't see any reason to come back anytime soon. That whole stretch of Lincoln Park/New Town/Lakeview is plenty nice, but lacks character. It has many amenities, but has no soul. I take it as a sign of my maturing over the past few however long that I can see that now: having a Blockbuster on the corner and a Borders down the block are not the seeds of a happy life. Such things just put pressure on you to be something you're not.[1]\n\nSuch things do remind me of my present living situation: I'm alone, but I live in a double suite. Right this minute, I have the biggest single room on campus, because my assigned roommate is nowhere to be found. I take this to mean, karmically, this: I've been given an incredible gift, my life and my freedom back, with the clear understanding that it can be taken from me at any moment. So I should, like, not take shit for granted, and stuff.\n\nEnough ennui -- now back to your regularly scheduled program of cookies and martinis."

    description: "In which I shop for groceries efficiently, and without any deaths."
    body: "<a href=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/shop-and-scan.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open('http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/shop-and-scan.jpg','popup','width=465,height=404,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false\"><img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/m/images/shop-and-scan-tm.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"172\" alt=\"shop-and-scan\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px; border: 1px solid #999\" /></a>It's an idea whose time has come. Jewel-Osco's newish supermarket at Roosevelt &#38; Wabash in Chicago has installed a shop-and-scan system, which shoppers use to ring up their groceries _as they pick them off the shelf_. While I'm not necessarily a fan of technologies that cut out good ole' human interaction, this system is so freaking useful that I can live with not getting to say hi to a checker again.\n\nHow it works is: you scan your registered Jewel Preferred Customer Card[1] at the Shop-and-Scan station by the entrance, and the computer assigns you a scanner gun which is wirelessly connected to the store's computer. You are now a walking cash register, and when you decide you want to buy something, you just scan it. Because the system is keyed to your Preferred Card, you automatically get the sale prices on everything. If you decide you don't want something, you can press a delete key, re-scan the item to confirm and just put it back. When you're done shopping, you check the scanner gun back in and go  through a self-checkout station to pay and bag. Then again, if you're like me, you used the pre-bagging station in the back of the store so really you just have to swipe your debit card and walk out.\n\nThere's obviously a time savings involved, but the biggest advantage is getting to see a running total of your order -- with sales tax and discounts already figured in -- as you shop. So if you look down and see that (ohmigod!) you're spending a few hundred dollars more than you planned to, you can just un-scan and put back those bottles of Dom Perignon.\n\nWhat this really accomplishes is not so much saving you more time so that you can resume your busy schedule of soccer-momming or porn-watching, but getting your sixty-seven-item ass out of line to make more room for the rest of us. I may not love small talk with the checkers, but I love standing in line behind an old lady with a million jars of gefilte fish even less. Let's just say that of all the solutions to that problem involving a pistol grip, I'm glad it's this one."
    extended: "I will also note that this particular Jewel store has a low-ceilinged, pleasantly lit feel that I find quite enjoyable. I hereby demand that Jewel/Osco/Albertsons management alter reality to place _this_ Jewel on the empty lot across the street from me, and move the empty lot way the fuck out Roosevelt.\n\nAnd if that means that Daley has to convince Harrods to open a store on Roosevelt Road, so much the better.\n\nfn1. The Jewel-Osco version of the now-ubiquitous supermarket discount card, by which you become a source of marketing data in exchange for surprisingly good prices on food. The registration part is specific to Shop-and-Scan; you have to provide an up-to-date phone number and sign a form accepting the terms &#38; conditions of the service before they'll let you have a scanner gun."

    title: "On Rejection"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we consider what it means to be told no."
    body: "Theresa Neilsen Hayden, an editor for sci-fi publisher Tor Books, has blogged about \"oversensitive reactions by aspiring authors to their rejection letters.\":http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html#004641 (Link via \"boingboing\":http://boingboing.net/)\n\nBasically, people neglect to include a SASE, to research whether their work is apropos to a particular publisher's market, to write well-formed English, and then read into the form rejection letter to come to the conclusion that the editor is more concerned with keeping them out of some elite authors' club than with, you know, doing their job.\n\nThe lesson here is valuable for anyone aspiring to a career in a creative field: art is useless unless someone's gonna read/watch/listen to it. It's tempting to think that art at the service of commerce is somehow lacking, that is, if you're stupid. The reality is that just as true art has no obligation to be constrained to what's commercial, publishers have no obligation to publish your great opus just because you think it's art.\n\nIs every rejection fair? Not at all, but it is important to remember also that almost every rejection has nothing to do with you. The editor/interviewer/festival selection committee/director has their criteria, and you meet it or you don't. The criteria may be entirely meritocratic, or they may be biased in some weird way. Most likely, they're thinking of what serves them and their organization best, based on their own knowledge and experience.\n\nSee? Your artistic product is being judged against the knowledge and experience of someone who may not know their ass from their elbow. It has nothing to do with you, and it doesn't necessarily make you wrong, bad or crazy. However, they have a job and you don't, so it pays to at least listen them and filter their comments through your own knowledge and experience.\n\nA true artist has the perspective to recognize good criticism when they see it. A poseur just sees someone frontin'.\n\nRemember the first lesson of Robert S. McNamara: \"Empathize with your enemy.\""

A drink is not included, so for an extra \$3 I bought a glass of the same extra-spicy ginger ale served at Big Bowl.[2]\n\nI will say that for a seven-dollar meal, it was not very filling at all, but quite tasty. The _bao_ are wonderful, if a little more like a snack than a main dish. My favorite are the Mongolian beef, which appear to be the most popular -- they're savory and spicy, which goes well with the kinda-sweet _bao_ dough.\n\nThe broth was a nice surprise; it isn't as hot or sour as I'd have expected, more like plain chicken broth with a little spice and a twist of citrus. It comes in a paper coffee cup, which makes it a wonderful (and possibly cheaper) alternative to a cup of Starbucks.\n\nSo far I've found that the best way to experience _bao_ is at home: Wow Bao sells frozen six-packs which can be perfectly (and quickly) reheated in a microwave, provided you wrap them in plastic wrap, for convenient snackage."
    extended: "fn1. \n\nAnyone who goes to Water Tower Place may already be thinking: \"wait, the ground level?? There's nowhere to _sit_ on the ground level!!!\" And you'd be exactly right. It's a funny little counter stuck between the escalators and the entrance to Marshall Field's, with _ersatz_ seating upstairs in more or less the same place, such that if you order your _bao_ for here, they hand them to you on a brown tray and you then have to negotiate your way through the crowds of tourists carrying food.\n\nfn2. This is a point of confusion for me: Wow Bao is owned by Chicago's ubiquitous \"Lettuce Entertain You\":http://www.leye.com/restaurants/restaurants_index.htm restaurant empire, which (I want to say) at one time owned Big Bowl, which is currently operated by Brinker International (owners of such _haute cuisine_ establishments as Chili's). It could be a coincidence, this ginger ale, if it didn't taste _exactly_ like the stuff at Big Bowl."

    title: "Regarding the Oscars"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I discuss the nominations."
    body: "I don't know if it's the shorter nomination period or the screener ban or just that the crop of elderly voters all managed to die or go blind this year, but this year's Oscar nominations -- to be blunt -- kick ass.\n\nApart from the inevitable multitude of nominations for _Return of the King_ and _Mystic River_ (both more-satisfying-than-usual picks for Best Picture), I was pleased to see _Master and Commander_ wasn't totally overlooked, and some very surprising nominations going to some gems from overseas: the Portugese film _City of God_ (nominated for last year's Foreign Film Oscar, but not officially released in the U.S. until this year), as well as the animated _The Triplets of Belleville_.\n\nI try not to finalize my Oscar picks until the last weekend of the Oscars Game (more on this in a second), but I can tell you some winners I would _love_ to see, that wouldn't be all that far-fetched.\n\nh2. Acting\n\nI have seen neither Johnny Depp's performance in _Pirates of the Caribbean_, nor Bill Murray's in _Lost in Translation_, but I applaud their nominations. Conventional Oscar wisdom would have told me that because of these actors' tempraments, as well as recent statements that were \"un-American\" and dismissive of the Academy, respectively, that the sentimental Oscar voters would stay away. \n\nThe Supporting nominees are less interesting, which isn't as important since Tim Robbins will be a very deserving winner.\n\nI sort of wish that Naomi Watts, not Charlize Theron, was the front-runner for the Best Actress trophy, although my reasons for and against that are the same: what is the likelihood that Theron will ever do work this good again? Watts is one of the better actresses working today, just starting what will be an undoubtedly brilliant career. Theron's performance is brilliant, but why should she actually get the Oscar she deserves when actors like Watts, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe have to wait until they've been skipped twice, then get one for no reason at all?\n\nPut another way: what is the likelihood that, in fifty years, anyone will remember _any_ of Theron's roles, even this one? Okay, what about Watts/Crowe/Kidman?\n\nJust a nit-pick though -- most years, I would kill to have even one nominated performance this good to talk about.\n\nh2. Documentary\n\nI only just saw _The Fog of War_ last night -- knowing it was an Oscar nominee, although that had no bearing on my decision to hike out to Southport and see it -- and if it doesn't win the Oscar, there is no justice in this life. I agree with some critics that it's not the most hard-hitting documentary in the bunch, but it's definitely the most artful. On reflection, it seems like the movie Chris Marker would have made if he were doing segments for _Dateline NBC_ -- treading ground between reportage and poetry.\n\nh2. Editing\n\nFor Mac idolatry reasons, I want to see Walter Murch's editing of _Cold Mountain_ recognized with an Oscar, because it was the first time a major motion picture, with a major (nay, legendary) editor, was cut using a Final Cut Pro system.\n\nI have problems with the nomination for _Return of the King_'s Jamie Selkirk, by simple virtue of the \"six endings\" problem. I think it's an editorial decision that didn't work, that takes viewers out of the movie when they really need to be into it, and one that I hope is reconsidered when they're making the DVD edition of the film -- not rewarded with an Oscar nomination.\n\nh2. Writing\n\nLike Fernando Meirelles, I too wonder how the Portugese-language _City of God_ managed a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Perhaps the subtitle translators should be up there as co-nominees.\n\nh2. The Overlooked\n\nI'm not as upset about this as some people, but it's weird that _Kill Bill: Vol. 1_ was totally shut out -- either the Academy was put off by its violence, or have finally had enough of Miramax's crap.\n\nI'd love to know if Peter Biskind's _Down and Dirty Pictures_ -- just released and full of dirt on the Weinstein empire -- had anything to do with that company's relatively poor showing in this year's Oscar nominations. Bob and Harvey won't be hurting -- Miramax is one of the _three_ studios involved in _Master and Commander_, co-financed _House of Sand and Fog_ with archrivals DreamWorks, and the Weinsteins have an executive producer credit on the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy. But the movie they've been flogging as their Oscar horse, _Cold Mountain_, was shut out of the three categories they reportedly wanted most, Picture, Director (for Anthony Minghella) and Actress (for Nicole Kidman).\n\nHaving still not seen _Love Actually_, I can't speak from personal taste, but it would have seemed an obvious pick for at least a screenplay nod. Perhaps the Academy's Anglophiles are becoming, or being replaced by, the film school generation's Francophiles.\n\nh2. The Oscars Game\n\nI'm doing the last bit of data entry at this hour, with an eye to building the game database and scripts to let all you wild people make and edit your picks tonight or tomorrow.\n\nThere will be some new functionality (mobile phone access, maybe, and definitely a deadline alert that can be sent to your phone or pager), and for the first time ever, a Grand Prize for the highest scorer, even if nobody beats me. (The Grand, Grand Prize is still only awarded if someone beats my score, however.) Prizes, rules and scoring will be announced relatively soon."

I am a US citizen and I respect my government and if I don't like what is being done, I voice my opinion in places I should.   The night of the academies is not the place and it creates a bad taste for you to let that occur. Sean also feels free to send messages to Iraq running down our government. I have no respect for him, he should live in Iraq and see what their goverment is like. It is very sad for you to allow this on the Oscars night. I disliked everything Clinton stood for, but I would never show disrespect like this, as he our President and there used to be respect in this country. Some of the hollywood clan used to be people to look up to, now they are an embarrassment and are tearing down our establishment and teaching children to show disrespect. We have freedom of speech and that is privilege and I really don't care what they think politically, but some are carrying this too far.   God Bless AMerica!!!"

    title: "The year in cinema"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I assess last year's movies, and Jonathan Rosenbaum"
    body: "The esteemed critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who is the main movie reviewer for the _Chicago Reader_ as well as the author of _Movie Wars_ and other good texts about cinema, has just lost all his credibility in my eyes. This is to say that while I respect him for bucking the critical establishment and sticking to his guns on some sure-to-be-controversial opinions, it becomes clear to me now that there is no point where his taste in movies and mine overlap.\n\nTake as Exhibit A his \"top ten movies of 2003\":http://www.chireader.com/movies/archives/2004/0104/040102_2.html list, where he names _25th Hour_ (an Oscar contender from last year, released in Chicago in January '03) as co-best picture, and also cites _Cold Mountain_, _Masked and Anonymous_ and _All The Real Girls_ as standouts.\n\nI have seen none of these movies, but friends I trust and other critics whose opinions I value tell me that I'm not missing much, and unlike Jonathan Rosenbaum I don't have the luxury of seeing a movie like _Masked and Anonymous_ -- which nearly every critic, mainstream or otherwise, and most moviegoers are calling the worst film of the year, because _I_ have to pay for it.[1]\n\nAs for _25th Hour_, I considered seeing it, but never felt strongly enough to pull myself out of the apartment and drag ass all the way downtown for it. Recently a co-worker (whose opinions about movies I don't always agree with, but respect as being as learned and well-thought-out as my own) told me it wasn't that great. This moves it to the bottom of my list.\n\nRosenbaum shares my background somewhat -- we're both movie brats from Alabama, although while I was raised on recent studio fare I think he grew up on indie and foreign films, as well as the classics -- and he does agree with one of my opinions about one of the year's most talked-up films: that _Lost in Translation_ is \"a rich-kid's view of Tokyo\", redeemed only by the presence of Bill Murray.\n\nI would go so far as to describe Rosenbaum's list as nostalgic: he cites \"Down With Love\" (a satire of 50s-era Rock Hudson-Doris Day pictures), a documentary about Maya Deren, some of the Iranian/North African neorealist pictures he's written about for years, _The School of Rock_. While some of us are looking to the future of cinema, Rosenbaum, I think, is looking for something of the past in the present.\n\nI may not have seen ten pictures in 2003, but there were standouts, such that I can now make a list:\n\n* *Morvern Callar*: A portrait of a deadened soul, trying to find solace in consumerist culture -- or, at least, that's my simplest read on it. It's a movie that reduces Samantha Morton's boyfriend (who, at the opening of the film, has committed suicide) to a tape recorder, defines its heroine by her blank state and the fact that she works in a supermarket, and has her trying to escape her life by taking a packaged vacation. It's actually a little disconcerting that this isn't an American movie; perhaps it's just that most Americans lack the perspective to understand why this movie is disturbing. \n* *Mystic River*: Clint Eastwood's craft as a filmmaker is guileless -- you will never get a bravura tracking shot or even a jump cut out of him, but when he has a good script and good actors, it can be gold. What he has here is a solid Greekish tragedy, anchored by the excellent Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. If I have a complaint, it's that the women, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, are shafted in terms of characterization.\n* *Master and Commander*: Yes, it is a supremely boring film. It has a rhythm all its own, and that's what I like about it -- it places you aboard that ship, in the middle of conflict between empires, between classes, between man and nature. It works because of its simplicity.\n* *Bowling for Columbine*: I've written before that nobody's making angry films anymore. This movie is very fairly described as agitprop for the left, but you have to credit Michael Moore for having the balls to say something about our national obsession with killing each other.\n* *Kill Bill, Vol. 1*: Such concentrated joy for moviegoing, moviemaking, all things movie -- just exploding on the screen in a geeky orgasm of violence, Asian-sploitation, Blaxploitation and red, red vino. This is a movie which, by all rights and laws of nature, should not work. But it does.\n\nAnd a couple of films that may not have been great cinema, but cannot be avoided:\n* *The Return of the King*: The _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is one of the greatest works of modern cinema by sheer virtue of its audacity, yet while this final chapter has some of the trilogy's best material, I feel that it's also the most poorly-structured. In part because of the decision to move a good chunk of _Two Towers_ material into the third film, the movie's three-and-a-half-hour running time feels way too short -- very few scenes are given room to breathe, so that the movie we're seeing, I suspect, is a lot less subtle and artful than the movie they made. Also: the fadeouts at the end (the infamous \"six endings\") were unnecessary, and wreck the rhythm of an otherwise lovely coda. Hopefully next year's Extended DVD Edition will feel a little better.\n* *The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions*: Unlike many of you, I do not hate these movies, and wasn't expecting the second coming when they came out. I think _Reloaded_ is way too slow, while _Revolutions_ is way too fast. I think that the Zion stuff -- driven by a fetishization of otherness that would make Jonathan Demme do a double-take -- is just plain wrong, and that ultimately, the series simply wimped out. It could have been far more ambitious, and promised way more than it could ever deliver, settling instead for cheap thrills, cheap sex (the Neo-Trinity romance was, if possible, even worse than Natalie and Hayden in _Attack of the Clones_) and cheap philosophy. It's a movie that doesn't leave a sour taste in my mouth, but is certainly not a fully satisfying or filling meal."

NORDSTROM DISCOUNT STORE\n\nBeing generally unaware that any Nordstrom store carried homewares goodness, I was surprised to see relatively cheap, relatively fuzzy towels displayed prominently in Nordstrom Rack's front window. And so I'm like, _score(!)_, because while I'm short of cash, good looks and sexual gratification of late, I do have a Nordstrom charge card. And I need towels.\n\nA quick trip to their men's department -- which is what a T.J. Maxx would look like if Kenneth Cole had half an hour to redecorate it on an episode of \"While You Were Out\" -- revealed Ted Baker ties, Coach wallets and many other delightful things, all at...well, decent prices. Good prices, considering how much _more_ expensive these things are when they're at home.\n\nAt the very least, I can benefit from the apparent fact that Nordstrom jacked a shipment of Neutrogena face cleanser, which would be good news for my wallet even if I _didn't_ have a charge account there."

    title: "Evil schemes thwarted, \$20"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which a money-saving scheme costs me at least \$40."
    body: "p{font-style: italic}. \"Do you like black people?\" -- Homeless man asking me for -\$60- \$20 inside the supermarket, less than 30 minutes ago\n\nI had the most brilliant plan ever: I have a huge jar of change. I need groceries. There is a Dominick's supermarket at Halsted and Madison, roughly one mile from here, which would be walking distance were it not negative umpteen degrees and hella windy outside. There is a Jewel supermarket even closer, less than half a mile along a major bus line, but the Dominick's has one major advantage: according to Coinstar's website, they have a Coinstar machine.\n\nThis appealed to me, because it would allow me to kill at least two birds with no more than one stone. I could dump all of my change into the Coinstar machine, and rather than cashing out as I would at the next-nearest machine at Clark and Division (and taking the 15% or whatever service fee hit), I would trade the change for my groceries. So simple, so elegant. And once again, I prove that I am a Super Genius(tm), because no mere genius could screw something up _this_ badly.\n\nAll this scheming depended on one thing: the Coinstar machine. No Coinstar = Screwed. Or more specifically, the lack of a Coinstar machine would mean that I had gone blocks upon hellish blocks out of my way, ventured into a slightly less whiteyfied neighborhood and then forced to haul bags of groceries back through that same distance, for absolutely no reason.\n\nGuess what happened?[1]\n\nAs if that weren't terrible enough, while I had made sure to stick a Jewel-Osco discount card in my wallet (plannning since this morning to hit Jewel, not Dominick's, for my provisions) I don't even _have_ a Dominick's card right now. And most everything I bought was on sale if and only if one used the discount card.\n\nI restricted my shopping to the essentials -- milk, bread, Diet Coke with Lime, four boxes of Raisin Bran Crunch -- and got the hell out of there. On my way out the door, I had to explain to a very big, very homeless black man that I didn't have any cash, let alone -\$60- \$20.[2] Then, as I'm finally walking out to catch my bus back home, I head down Madison Street to the next bus stop...only to find that at this hour, the Madison bus turns onto Halsted before heading back into the Loop. So I start running like Forrest to catch this bus, and I make it to within six inches of the door when it closes and the bus pulls away. I run after it, scream obscenities at the driver, whatever.\n\nSo I'm forced to get cash from an ATM and catch a cab. It is freezing and I know that the next bus will be at least ten minutes. I am not willing to wait. I am also operating under yet another assumption: that the cab driver will have a ten dollar bill to give me as change. I only had a twenty; I was hesitant, but generally willing to just accept a ten -- maybe a ten and a couple of ones -- which would have been a huge tip for the (as it turned out) \$5 cab ride.\n\nGuess what happened?[3]"
    extended: "fn1. If you had to click on this footnote...my gah. Long story short: the Coinstar machine was out of order.\n\nfn2. I feel for the guy -- going broke and having to live with one's mother for seven months will do wonders for one's empathy for the homeless -- but I mean, come on. He opened by asking \"do [I] like black people?\", and then he asks me for \$60. Granted, I am a white person in a relatively expensive, rather elegant wool coat. This is significant, because while your rank-and-file whitey (as identified by any winter attire that is clearly not secondhand, from parkas to peacoats, yet not long or woolen or Pradaesque) who does _not_ have \$60+ just bursting to break free from the oppressive confines of their velcro-and-cordura Da Bears wallet, the fine lambskin billfold one could easily imagine resting in my inside coat pocket just may contain the riches this man sought.\n\np(footnote). Anyway, the point is: after seven months spent in the casually racist South as one of the more enlightened individuals who sees value in all people, with the possible exception of my fellow white males, it's a bit of a trip to come back to Chicago, to Winter and a recession, and find the battle lines between the skin colors as finely drawn as ever.\n\nfn3. God, you have no talent for inference, do you? The guy didn't have a ten."

    title: "Three Buck Chuck and other stories"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I go shopping."
    body: "h2. Regarding the CTA's S-M-R-T card\n\nA few quick, Chicago-related notes tonight. First, Practical reader Ryan writes in to report that the Chicago Card Plus I wrote about this week is not totally, 100% operational:\n\nbq. The CTA hasn't made its employees aware that the cards are already available. My card isn't charged for transfers for some reason. So far I haven't gotten a response from the CTA yet on the matter.\n\nSo...are they working, but just not charging for transfers? I would think that that's a good thing.\n\nh2. Three Buck Chuck\n\nNext, for those Chicagoans who've been interested to hear about Trader Joe's line of \$2 Charles Shaw wines (known colloquially as Two Buck Chuck), a few tips:\n* Here, presumably due to the additional cost of shipping these Californian wines to Illinois, and perhaps also vagaries of Illinois state liquor laws, in Chicago it's more appropriate to call them Three Buck Chuck, as Charles Shaw retails for \$2.99. That said, one can buy a bottle of xBC, a corkscrew because you were too dumb to remember to pack one and a jar of unsalted organic crunchy peanut butter for less than the cost of a tiny split bottle of Coppola merlot.\n* There are two Chicago-area Trader Joe's stores; the one on Clybourn Avenue in Lincoln Park may be more accessible to some of you, as it is to me. If you want to save some time, look for the elevator which is (I think) just past Bombay if you're walking North(west) on Cly. But if you're looking for an interesting time, and possibly to kill yourself, you can do what I did and run up the parking garage ramp to get in. What I mean to say here is that the only entrance to the store is inside the parking deck, and you can get there the easy way, or you can get there the hard way.\n* In addition to cheap-ass wines, you can also purchase _real_ wines, including a Trader Joe's house label which looks promising. (Four Buck Jethro?) Additionally, there is a vast panoply of TJ-branded gourmet goodies at reasonable prices. Now, when I say reasonable, I mean that you could, if you wanted to spend half an hour at Whole Foods _looking_ for it, find a more expensive jar of spreadable strawberry gunk. Or you could just go downtown and buy a jar of Smuckers for \$1.50 on sale.\n\nh2. Coffee consumerism\n\nThe Bloomingdale's Home Temple[1] won my heart when I first looked at their really frighteningly extensive coffee-equipment department; tonight I finally got a chance to partake of same. In addition to my bed linens, I picked up a hot water kettle (for the consumption of ramen and tea) and, even better, a Bodum Electric Mini Santos vacuum brewer.\n\nStarbucks patrons may recall the Barista Utopia vacuum brewer, which made quite a show of brewing coffee through a process we lovingly liked to call \"nuking\" it[2]. The Santos is Bodum's name for that coffeemaker, which we sold exclusively under our own brand name until Bodum realized that Amazon.com and Bloomingdales could actually _sell_ the fuckers. The Mini Santos is something I've thought needed to exist for a long time: a 5-cup version, perfect for use in, hmmmmm, a dorm room perhaps?\n\nThis is significant why: Vacuum-brewed coffee, at least as made with a Bodum Santos, has all the flavor of press-brewed coffee (which is to say, a hell of a lot of flavor) and most of the convenience of a regular drip coffeemaker.\n\nCombine this with a half-pound of something or other from Intelligentsia and we're awwwwwll goood, baby."
    extended: "fn1. I.e., the Bloomingdale's home and housewares store, which is located in the former (and quite beautiful) Medinah Temple building at Wabash and Ohio.\n\nfn2. Actually, we never did call it this, and I'm sorry to report that this was the funniest adjective I could come up with on such short notice. However, when I revise this post to include a review of Three Buck Chuck, I'll see if I can't come up with something a little more disgusting.\n\nMy laptop's ethernet card port thing has always glowed gold when connected to the network; now it is green. This is the first time it's ever been on an actual T3-ish network, as opposed to DSL. So is it a firewall thing? Is it speed? What? What?!?! (Those inclined to answer: it's one of those big, blue 3COM Ethernet/56K modem combo cards.)"

I'm back on my preferred Windows client, Trillian, which like Proteus can chat on all four major IM networks (AIM, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo), as well as good old Internet Relay Chat (IRC). While it's undoubtedly more powerful than iChat AV, and more stable and usable than recent Proteus releases, it still ain't a piece of Mac software.\n\nOne major good point: it can connect to multiple accounts on any network, so I am currently logged in using _both_ my AIM names.\n\nThe major bad point: its sound effects are totally useless. I keep hearing a shimmering ambient kinda sound that could mean someone is coming online, or that I received an e-mail message, or that it's gonna rain. I don't know. I've just tweaked the sound scheme (using sounds from AOL) to be a little more user-friendly, but I missed three or four messages last night because there was no good way for Trillian to tell me I had them.\n\nAnd what's this shit where, if I press the shiny green button, the IM window disappears into this weird-ass drawer on my buddy list, but _not_ the Taskbar?"

    body: "So far, everyone I tell about my trip has said the same thing: \"dayamn, it's _cowld_ up theah in Chicahgo!\" (Except for the nice German lady, who said \"mein gott, ist _cold_ up zere in Chicago!\")\n\nAccording to Weather.com, the current temperature in the Loop is 23&deg;, \"feels like 13&deg;,\" with light snow falling. This is, of course, quite cold, but entirely normal and tolerable by Chicago standards, whereas my co-workers were bitching and agog(!) when the mercury _dared_ to drop below 35&deg; last week.\n\nAt any rate, people are never quite able to get a handle on the idea that someone can be _prepared_ for Chicago weather when coming from the comparatively balmy Alabama sunshine. It's like, I say \"I know, it's okay,\" and they're like, \"no, dude, you don't _understand_. It's _cold_ in Chicago.\" And I say _I know_, and they're like, _no, you don't know. How can you know? How can anyone know?? It is unknown!!_\n\nMy provisions are thus far broken down into \"kits\" -- I have the Computer Kit, the Bathroom Kit and the In Case Of Plane Crash In The Alps Human Flesh Cooking Kit. My Winter Weather Kit is as follows:\n\n* Two pairs of 180s-brand wraparound ear warmers, only one of which was found on the sidewalk in Lincoln Park\n* Two pairs of gloves, one faux leather with a faux lambswool lining, the other faux leather and neoprene. (Probably faux neoprene.)\n* Red Kangol stocking cap with storied history and itchy inner lining.\n* Two pairs fuzzy (faux) woolen socks from the Gap.\n* Gorilla Feet, which is to say, a pair of fuzzy slippers in the shape of gorilla heads. Size 11.\n* Fleecy blanket emblazoned with Starbucks logo. Will be used if temperature drops below 20&deg;, or in aforementioned human flesh-eating scenario.\n* Black fedora hat, with Worst Case Scenario-brand guide on What To Do If Some Idiot Asks, \"Hey, Are You One Of Those Black Hats?\"\n* A sweater with snowflakes on it, because it just wouldn't be winter in the Midwest without a truly ridiculous snowflake-ridden sweater."
    extended: "Those concerned about the contents of my In Case Of Plane Crash In The Alps Human Flesh Cooking Kit (ICOPCITAHFCK), worry not. If forced into that regrettable (but, let's face it, inevitable) scenario, I will be well-prepared.\n\nWhile FAA/TSA regulations prohibit passengers like myself from having knives, blowtorches, Presto Logs, bone saws and La Creuset pans in the cabin, there is no such rule preventing such things from being in one's carry-on baggage, and I would assume that amidst the total breakdown of order and human decency that would follow a catastrophic plane crash in the Alps, _someone_ would have the kindness to break into the cargo hold for -me- us, allowing ready access to the ICOPCITAHFCK.\n\nYou may be wondering why such preparations for a crash in the Alps are necessary, especially for a flight from Birmingham to Chicago, both of which are (as of last check) well inside the continental United States. I say that it's that kind of thinking that caught us off-guard on 9/11. When Al-Qaeda attacks next, they will not strike at our cities or our infrastructure or even our beloved reality talent show programming.\n\nNo, they will strike at our American traditions of reason and logic, and in such a post-de-reconstructionist environment, who is to say with any certainty that a plane flying from Birmingham to Chicago will _not_ potentially fly over, and crash-land in, the Swiss Alps? And who is to say that it is insane to spend one's entire life carrying around Presto Logs and a bone saw in the unlikely event that a total breach in the fabric of space-time as a result of a terrorist attack will necessitate snowbound cannibalism?\n\nI see that you have answers to both of those questions, and as such, have ceased to listen."

    body: "It's all over but the paperwork, as I've packed and shipped the iMac and purchased two very, _very_ large duffel bags to take with me to Chicago on Sunday. Tonight there shall be an orgy of preparation, stuffing crap into bags and boxes while I watch the final night of Great Dictators Week on the History Channel.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm stuck back in the Windows world -- with the Mac (and my DVD collection) in the gentle, heavily insured care of FedEx, I'm back to using my laptop for everything and I find myself thrown off by some of its quirks. For example, I'm used to the _Matrix_-themed sound set I've been hearing in iChat to tell me when someone is coming online, leaving or sending me a message. I have no fucking idea what that _blooooop-a-blooop_ sound coming from Trillian is; I'm assuming someone has just gone offline, although it could mean that the software is trying to annoy me to death.\n\nOh, and FeedDemon? Lovely concept if you're a masochist who actually _enjoys_ using Microsoft Outlook. See, I don't, which is why I've been using and enjoying Mozilla Thunderbird for all my e-mail needs. So I expect that I'll be rather out of the loop insofar as my RSS reading is concerned until I get my computer back on -Wednesday- November 15th.[1]\n\nThere has also been a disagreement with Southwest Airlines as to the exact definition of a \"personal item\". Historically they have allowed a briefcase/messenger bag/laptop case, as well as the requisite one piece of carry-on luggage, to come into the cabin. However, when I double-checked with one of their helpful phone reps, they seemed hung up on the word \"bag\".\n\n\"Like,\" she said, \"you can bring your laptop, but if it's in a bag with like clothes and stuff...\"\n\"Yes, but if the laptop is in a case. Like no bigger than the laptop.\"\n\"Well, you can bring a laptop, but...\"\n\"It can't be in a messenger bag?\"\n\"Ummm...\"\n\nMy assumption, based on this conversation, is that my Kenneth Cole messenger containing one (1) laptop, its accessories, a CD player, a moleskine notebook and a stack of magazines is acceptable as a \"personal item.\" If the same bag were to contain the above-listed items, plus _one white athletic sock_, it becomes luggage and has to be checked into cargo.[2]"
    extended: "fn1. 51 pounds of equipment (and padding), delivered via ground transport and promised by Wednesday: \$32.00. That said, my dorm's mailroom will manage to lose it (1-2 days), then forget to give me the package notice (1 day) which they just lost anyway (2 days) until finally they look in their binder and see that I still haven't picked the thing up, walk down the hall and leave a *FINAL NOTICE* in my box. By which time I'll have become so accustomed to living without a computer -- and probably having a lot more sex, since I'll be without my most constant non-human distraction -- I'll get the notice, see that the office staff is out to lunch _again_ and just say fuck it and go back to bed.\n\nfn2. Anyone who thinks that they're not serious about the FAA-mandated 1.5-carry-on rule should pay heed to the following story: last summer I boarded a Southwest jet carrying my usual two bags -- a smallish American Tourister suitcase and my Kenneth Cole messenger -- plus a small Gap shopping bag containing a medium-sized teddy bear. _And they didn't say a word_, until we landed in Chicago, where one of the flight attendants came over and said, \"you know, next time we have to ask that you only bring _two_ carry-on bags into the cabin. You see, we _only_ allow _two_ carry-on bags.\"\n\nI was pissed as hell, not by what he was saying -- because he was absolutely right that I had just gotten away with murder, in the sense that anything more serious would have had me deplaned, deported and added to the No-Fly List. No, it was his tone that offended me, Dear Reader, his way of treating me like something less of a person because I just flaunted a rule that, golly gee, they should have enforced _before_ flying me 700 miles across the country.\n\nThe moral of the story is that if you're already carrying two pieces of luggage, you can probably bring your teddy bear along provided that you don't put him inside a Gap bag. And remember to bring his ID, for when he asks for a chocolate martini midway through the flight."

    title: "Pancakes!!!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which my passion for Chicago's eclectic brunch offerings is expressed."
    body: "I've just learned that my favorite supplier of pancakes and other breakfast foods, Orange[1], is opening a second location in the South Loop.\n\nUpon reading on \"Metromix\":http://metromix.com/ that Orange on Harrison was to open in January, I called them and asked, \"when are you open?\" I figured that this ambiguously-worded question would suffice whether the place were open already or not.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the guy said that O.o.H. would be opening this very weekend (i.e., Friday), \"barring any unforseen catastrophes. (Beat.) Like an explosion or something.\" Assuming that this mysterious explosion remains shrouded in the mists of this man's imagination, pancakes can be had starting at 7 AM on weekday mornings.\n\nMetromix claims that O.o.H. will be carrying over the eclectic, tasty menu from the Lakeview place, which includes:\n\n* Green eggs and ham (that's ham and eggs with pesto)\n* Ham &#38; cheese omelet, with a dash of dijon\n* Steak &#38; eggs benedict, which is poached eggs atop a tender beef filet, atop toasted brioche, drizzled with a balsamic reduction and served with po'taters\n* The Pancake Flight, which is five stacks of silver-dollar pancakes all based on that week's theme, e.g., flowers or booze or something\n* Fresh juices of all kinds\n* Frushi. That's fruit sushi.\n\nI'd imagine that this move into the South Loop is at least partly in response to the opening of Room 12, which is a recently-opened South Loop version of Wicker Park's Bongo Room. Which is in turn a response to the South Loop's emergence as the next hot neighborhood. Which is in turn a response to Lincoln and Wicker Parks being, like, over.\n\nAs pertains to Chicago's brunch joints, I claim allegiance to neither Orange nor the Bongo Room/Room 12. However, if war is to break out, I will side with either one against Toast, whose day of reckoning is at hand. (But only between the hours of 7 and 3.)[2]"

    description: "In which I remove a huge chunk from my old notebook, and reflect on its contents."
    body: "As part of my preparation to go back to the City, I decided to sit down and do something I've been dreading: go through my old Moleskine notebook (namesake brand of this weblog) to cull useless pages, read over old notes and annotate, mostly to decide whether I should keep this journal or start a new one when I get back to Chicago.[1] I'm gonna start a new one, as once my editing was done, I'd taken a very noticeable chunk out of the center of the notebook, which threw off the way it lays flat on a surface. Which, of course, won't do at all.\n\nIt's a shame what I let happen to my moleskine: having filled it with anti-Jennyisms that I then saw fit to cut out in much the same way I cut out the real Jenny, I started using it as a class notebook. And not even a good class!.[2]\n\nThere are some interesting ideas for stories in there, though, and I marked them with a highlighter when I thought there was something worth exploring. There were copious notes about my stillborn romantic comedy (that I may now finally be back in the mood to write), my _Matrix_ ripoff with a title stolen from _The Sandman_ and a central mythology stolen from _Paradise Lost_, my postmodern reimagining[3] of _The Third Man_...\n\nIt is the stated opinion of certain family members (COUGH my mother COUGH COUGH) that I am a much stronger critical writer than fiction writer, which I'm not sure I can argue with. I would argue that I'm a stronger movie producer than an editor, a stronger editor than writer, and a stronger writer than director, but that's just my ever-fallible self-analysis. The point is, in this notebook I see imagination I had forgotten I had, which is a lovely thing to look over now that things are quieter."
    extended: "I started this entry intending only to post, uselessly, that I had gotten my laptop and cellphone talking via Bluetooth, which makes it possible for me to blog/e-mail/look at porn from literally anywhere. (I've got your Wi-Fi right here, fuckers!!!) However, I decided to take the opportunity to, you know, actually write.\n\nfn1. While I found pocket-size Moleskines at Books & Company here in Birmingham, I know of only two places that carry the full-size version I use for my journal: a lovely stationer's on Rue Chartres in 'Nawlins whose name I have completely forgotten (Typographica?), and The Art Store in Chicago. I am certain that there are other places, like the other stores in the Art Store chain, and finer stationery stores for whom the Moleskine (\$13.95 for less than 200 leaves) would be their low-end, mass-market product. But those are the only two _I_ know about.\n\nfn2. I did manage to make one decent note in my poor, ravaged notebook about that class. The teacher (who shall remain nameless) was rambling about something or other, as was his wont, and I wrote:\n\nbq. This man's relationships must be hell.\n\nfn3. Read: ripoff."

    title: "\"Big Fish\""
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I review the new Tim Burton movie."
    body: "Tim Burton's new movie is loaded with amazing images, and features some wonderful performances, but itt's too episodic and disjointed to coalesce into anything more than a confection. It's emotional, but it doesn't fully deliver like a full-scale Hollywood weepie ought to, and Burton's imagination -- which at this point could out-Fellini Fellini -- is working overtime to pick up the slack.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the script pretty much demands that the audience accept the larger-than-life Edward Bloom (played as a young man by Ewan MacGregor, as an older one by Albert Finney) -- any failure to sell us on Edward, and the movie falls apart. And it fails, because we never see Edward as totally human. The young man of his tall tales is invincible, such that he never has to struggle for anything -- he even wins the love of his life specifically by _not_ fighting for her. The older Edward, meanwhile, is just a dying man on a bed. Nowhere in between do the two meet.\n\nThe closest the movie comes to being poignant is in the scene where Billy Crudup's character goes to visit Helena Bonham Carter's, and in true Fellini fashion all the women in Edward's life who _aren't_ his wife and one true love are neatly bought together in one person, played by Carter as only slightly less burnt-out than her Marla Singer in _Fight Club_.\n\nEdward's fantasy and real lives are kept so separate that we come to think that he never really existed in either, when we desperately want to believe he was able to live in both. _That_ would have made him a big fish -- to be able to live a normal life with such _joie de vivre_ that even the smallest, saddest moments were larger than life.\n\nAs it is, the fantasies are an escape from a perfectly delightful reality, and while there's an intimation that Edward was as uncomfortable in the fantasy world as in the real world, mostly what we get is the idea that this guy doesn't like his life so he invented a whole other one. Well, _I_ would like his life -- his wife is gorgeous, his son is successful and married to a wonderful woman and his friends are only slightly less colorful than his stories make them out to be. So what's the problem?\n\nThis is enough of a Hollywood movie that it can't handle that kind of ambiguity very well. That there are two different sides to Edward's life is hammered into our heads, and Burton has made the fantasies so attractive that we can't just slide back into the real world and not think of it as less fabulous. We identify reality with Albert Finney as the old man, desperately clinging onto life and old stories, and with Billy Crudup as a young man so level-headed as to not buy into any of the dreams."

If this is the case, I will adjust the clock accordingly.\n\nh2. One other change\n\nOn individual entry pages, the Prosaic Hierarchy (\"this, which is part of that...\") has been slightly tweaked to be more readable, if somewhat clunkier.\n\nTotal accessibility nuts would take me to task over the fact that I now use at least two different link styles in my sidebar on those pages: un-underlined for the Recent Additions, and underlined for the Prosaic Hierarchy (PH). This is for purely aesthetic reasons, as the center-justified Additions look better without it, and the left-justified PHes look better with it. It's my site and I'll break the rules if I want to.

    title: "Palm, Bluetooth and my enduring anger"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I vow never to buy another PalmOne product, at least until the Tungsten T3 goes on clearance."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/palm-bluetooth.jpg\" height=\"235\" width=\"177\" align=\"right\" alt=\"palm-bluetooth\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px\" />I now hate Palm. Passionately. I love my Tungsten E, very much I do, but I hate the company that makes it.\n\nI had called PalmOne's technical support department to double-check that the company's Bluetooth SDIO card is compatible with my handheld, and they assured me that it was. This was _before_ I ordered it. So I ordered it, and it was subsequently delayed at least once, had to be upgraded to next-day delivery and finally arrived yesterday, only for me to find the following written on the front of the packaging in very clear lettering:\n\nbq. NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PALM OS 5 HANDHELDS\n\nHmm. My Tungsten E runs Palm OS 5. Yet PalmOne assured me that it would work. So I downloaded the most recent drivers and tried it anyway, to no avail. I got a \"Bluetooth\" option to appear in my Tungsten's preferences screen, but when I tap on it nothing happens.\n\np(hidden). \"Continue reading &raquo;\":/moleskine/arch/2004/01/ihatepalm"
    extended: "Finally, I give up and call PalmOne again for assistance. I will take this moment to mention that although Palm's _not_ toll-free number places them in the suburbs of Chicago, every agent I've spoken with there has a very thick Indian accent. Not Hispanic. Not Ebonics. Universally Indian. Well, maybe Pakistani, but given the recent trend of U.S. companies outsourcing call-center jobs to Bangalore, I'm thinking Indian. The slight fuzziness on the line -- which seems to suggest that my call isn't exactly going to anywhere on _this_ continent -- backs up my suspicions.\n\nI have no problem with the people of India, and I've been relatively neutral on the whole U.S.-jobs-going-to-India thing, but only because no company that I do business with has done that to me until now. It's not just that their accents make it hard to communicate with them, but that they don't appear to be at all trained to deal with anything that isn't in their scripts. This is a problem even at U.S.-based call centers, and here as there, it's a result of a company not caring enough about their customers to pay for decent training for their helpdesks. If an Indian has the training and talent to help me troubleshoot my problem, more power to them.\n\nThe very polite yet woefully unqualified people on PalmOne's support line kept me on hold -- on a long-distance phone call that I can only hope cost Palm more money than it cost me -- for fifteen minutes while they claimed to be recreating my problem in their laboratory.[1] She came back to inform me that the card is not compatible with my handheld.\n\nh2. Neglect is one thing, but...\n\nOkay, fine: I can't use PalmOne's Bluetooth card with this handheld. So I start researching third-party options, either for a new card or some homebrew drivers for this card.\n\nWhat I found out, if such a thing is possible, pissed me off even more than the shoddy service.\n\nThe reason the card is not compatible with any Palm OS 5 handhelds -- which includes all current models from PalmOne/Handspring, Sony, Garmin, you name it -- is that Palm has decided that the development costs for new drivers would not be covered by the increase in sales. This much is obvious; it's also why companies rely on third-party developers to cover small niche markets that they don't feel like going after themselves.\n\nHowever, Palm's policies are actively preventing development of new drivers by third parties, \"as outlined on this page.\":http://www.whizoo.com/bluetooth.php It would seem that while they have no interest in providing a Bluetooth option for their low-end customers themselves, they're also opposed to anyone else doing it.\n\nThe only explanation I can think of: they are trying to get people who need the features in a Tungsten E plus Bluetooth to buy the Tungsten T2 or T3 instead, or better yet, to have already bought a T-E and then upgrade, because Palm makes tons more money on new handhelds than on accessories like SDIO cards.\n\nh2. Like Hell I will\n\nOne of the things that attracted me to the Tungsten E was that while I wasn't sure if I'd ever need any of the wireless features found in more expensive Palm handhelds, I could always add it later via the SDIO slot. Of course, at the time I was thinking Wi-Fi, not even considering that I might find a definite need for Bluetooth, or that Palm's Bluetooth card would be totally inoperable with any of their current products.\n\nIt's obvious now that unless PalmOne changes their policies w/r/t developing device drivers or allowing other companies to develop drivers, my only option is to buy a new handheld. Which, needless to say, is not really an option at all. I love my Tungsten E and would prefer it even to a Tungsten T2, which is \$100 more in price and virtually identical in every way but one: the T2 has Bluetooth.\n\nGiven this horrible customer service experience, and the knowledge that if anything ever goes wrong and I need technical help that I won't get it, I'm really reticent to buy a PalmOne product again. And this is what hurts worst of all, because I've been delighted with both the Palm handhelds I've owned so far, whereas the current low-end Sony CLIEs look too big and clunky for my taste, and the more appealing high-end models are too damned expensive.\n\nAnd with the buyout of Handspring, there are no other companies making general-use Palm handhelds. Since Pocket PCs don't (easily) work with the Mac, I feel like I'm stuck with choosing between one company whose service sucks, and another whose products I don't like.\n\nWith the far more advanced Palm OS 6 coming out this year anyway, perhaps an upgrade is in my future. But given this experience, I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about that as I should be.\n\nfn1. Incidentally, the lady's pronounciation of laboratory was the surest indicator yet that she does not live in this country. That is to say, she pronounces it correctly."

    title: "O brave new world, that has such media in it"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we ponder the fragmentation of thought, after this brief message from Windex."
    body: "p{font-style: italic}. <img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/howard-beale.jpg\" height=\"236\" width=\"177\" align=\"right\" alt=\"howard-beale\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px\" />\"There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the means by which to detect lies.\" -- Walter Lippman\n\nI'm about three-quarters through _Amusing Ourselves To Death_ by Neil Postman, and it's been a truly depressing, if not surprising, read. Postman's thesis is basically that it's Huxley's hedonistic _Brave New World_, not Orwell's totalitarian _1984_, that was the more prophetic. Huxley's world is here now, brought about by the power of television which has reduced public discourse, and even the quality of thought in our society, to only what trivialities can be squeezed in between commercials.\n\nI've already decided to write an essay about this topic soon, but there's a couple pieces of media that spring to mind immediately as predictors, propagators and products of the trivialization of that which should be serious\n\np(hidden). \"Continue reading &raquo;\":/moleskine/arch/2004/01/bravenewworld"
    extended: "Paddy Chayevsky's _Network_, which is frighteningly timely in this age where Michael Jackson's CBS special and _60 Minutes_ interview air in the same ratings week. In that movie, Peter Finch isn't saying anything that Postman (w/r/t television) or CNN's Lou Dobbs (w/r/t American business &#38; culture) aren't saying now, but there's two very important lessons to be learned from his character. One is that in the movie, Howard Beale is clearly a lunatic. Second is that lunatic or not, right or not, Beale's value both to his audience and his network is that he discusses very serious matters in a way that gets people emotionally involved and _keeps them entertained_. The only plot point in that movie that I've never quite bought is that Howard Beale could move people to actually send thousands of telegrams to the White House. What seems more genuine is the studio audience that watches him silently until he passes out, upon which a stagehand rushes out and motions for them to applaud. There is no concern for the person of Howard Beale, only for the _feeling_ he has produced, momentarily, in the mind of the viewer. He may as well be a crack pipe.\n\nThen there's the current state of coverage on CNN, which seemingly gets a bit worse every day despite their self-proclaimed status as America's most trusted news source. CNN has developed the schizophrenic, capsulized style of network news to a new level, repeating the exact same thirty-second stories several times throughout the day, expanding on that coverage only to give their pundits a chance to express an opinion, which (as observed by Postman) isn't so much a true argument or counter-argument as it is a kneejerk emotional response, intended to evoke in the audience (guess what?) a kneejerk emotional response. It's like a sideshow, where the Paul O'Neill allegations are the fire eater and the pirated Oscar screener that ended up online is the bearded lady. Such a situation is preferable only to the strip club that is Fox News -- what good is the lesser of two evils if they've managed to completely annihilate that which is good?\n\nI would not begin to suggest any kind of corporate conspiracy to prevent Americans from getting a full picture of what's going on in the world, but rather express the concern that thanks to television, to be constantly starved for the newest thing and depressed because one's own life pales in comparison to the perfect fictions coming over that tube is now the American condition. Our worship of technology has reached a frightening new level, we are more blind to what is real and human than ever before, and my worry is that sooner or later this most fatal weakness will be exploited.\n\nHitler, it is said, once remarked that people will believe any lie so long as it's big enough. Right now, people believe that whether Michael Jackson -- a profoundly screwed-up man most of us have never and will never meet -- groped a 12-year-old boy is more important than what's going on in our own lives. That sounds like a pretty big lie to me.\n\nSomeone pass me the _soma_."

    body: "I've already linked to \"this image series showing one geek's progression from flab to fab\":http://images.twowiresthin.com/all/front/da.html in the Remaindereds for today, but I feel compelled to comment upon what's going on here.\n\nFor starters, I have never doubted that such prodigious weight loss is possible -- it's just something that requires more patience than I can muster. I'm not talking about having the willpower to lay off candy bars and go to the gym every day. This guy clearly knows what he's doing in terms of setting up his diet and exercise regimen, such that whatever his job he should probably go into business as a very, very expensive fitness coach.\n\nWhat's more, at the risk of psychoanalyzing someone merely upon seeing a few hundred nearly naked photographs of him, I'd imagine he has a passion for those kinds of details. A stray carb here or there doesn't bother me, as I have accepted that so long as I can successfully do ballet twirls in sneakers and Haggar slacks, I'm as fit and flexible as I need to be. This guy, however, is _concerned_ about what he _eats_. Why, I might even say he's..._obsessed_.\n\nIt does take a certain amount of compulsion to not only keep up with such a crash fitness regimen, not only to track one's body with photographs taken every single morning, not only to make sure that he's standing in exactly the same pose in the same spot at the same camera angle, exposure setting and white balance, but to then preface those photographs with an explanation of why he seems to be wearing the same boxers two days in a row sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of those boxers, after a while I came to miss those jaunty M&#38;Ms boxers. The progression became for me the story not only of a transformation, but the transition from prolonged adolescence into somewhat less prolonged adolescence, resembling adulthood, as symbolized by the phasing out of the M&#38;Ms boxers. It could also signify the newfound asceticism of the subject, who not only gives up carbs, a few hours of time each morning and a significant chunk of his dignity, but also sloughs off the trappings of capitalism and marketing.\n\nThus the story becomes more poignant, an emotional shading that's quite welcome after you've scrolled through two hundred photographs only to see a caption explain that only now has the fat loss phase ended, and you're now entering the _summer maintenance phase_. It's like that scene in _Spaceballs_ when they go to...LUDICROUS SPEED!!!!\n\nWell, in a way that's not."

    body: "In however many years -- oh, lord, is it six?? -- as a loyal Amazon.com customer (and associates program member site), I have had to call their customer service hotline only three times. Unfortunately, two of those were this week.\n\n(What? You didn't know they had a \"phone number where you could talk to actual people?\":http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000241.php Of course you didn't. Link via \"BoingBoing\":http://www.boingboing.net/.)\n\nThe first time was after I got an e-mail telling me that the Bluetooth card for my Palm was going to be delayed, which (had I not called) would have placed it on my doorstep about two days after I had stepped through it for the last time, never to return. I called, bitched and got them to expedite the order, which (despite the delay) shipped the very next business day, with free next day shipping. Of course, now it's delayed because UPS are fuckups, but at least I get to deal with them now instead of _next_ week.\n\nThe current problem is not even Amazon's fault: the Postal Service decided that my copy of _Ikiru_ on DVD could not be delivered, even though it was shipped to the same address as all of the five or six items I've recently ordered from Amazon, and returned it to the company. The company's policy in such an event is to refund my money and cancel the order.\n\nSo I spoke with a very nice woman at Amazon just now, and expressed my frustration. \"I know it's not you guys's fault,\" I said, \"but I mean, I could call the Post Office and complain but I'd probably be better off yelling at my hydrangeas.\" She laughed, and offered a promotional certificate that would cover two-day shipping.\n\nOf course, it's not a \"free two-day shipping\" certificate -- it's just a normal \$10 certificate. On a \$35 item. From a company that offers free shipping on orders over \$25. So are you pondering what I'm pondering, Pinky?\n\n(Crickets chirping.)\n\nI suppose not. (Sighs.) And take off those rubber pants."

    title: "Perfect pancak-- I mean, thumbnails"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which we do not make pancakes, but rather teach PHP how to frame a shot."
    body: "<img src=\"http://practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/survivor-thumbs.jpg\" height=\"272\" width=\"202\" align=\"right\" alt=\"survivor-thumbs\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px\" />In the dim past, when this site covered _Survivor_ with more energy and intensity than it does today, I used to spend hours in Photoshop meticulously cropping and resizing the cast photos to make my own voting graphs, bio pages, et al. Today, through the marvelous power of web scripting, I can do all the same shit in about an hour by having the web server do all my image work on the fly.\n\nTonight's big innovation (which I'm unduly proud of) is a method for cropping a large, nonsquare picture into a perfectly composed square thumbnail. In previous lives, I would use a letter code (A, B or C) which would correspond to a region of the photo. For portrait-formatted images, that would be top, center and bottom. For landscape, left, center or right.\n\nThis was more than a little imprecise, but it got the job done. Tonight, though, I was looking at the manual entry for PHP's imagecopy function and had a brainstorm: why couldn't I go ahead and preset the dimensions for the thumbnail, store them in a comma-delimited string and just have the server use those instructions to make a perfect thumbnail on the fly?\n\n(Crickets chirping as my jargon has sliced the tops off your heads, much like Uma did to Lucy Liu in _Kill Bill_.)\n\nWell, trust me, it works. It requires a little more effort (specifically loading each of my source pics into Photoshop to measure out a thumbnail, then entering those measurements into the database), but it's way easier than hours spent slaving over a hot Photoshop, and the aesthetics work so well that it's worth the trifling pain.\n\nFor a good time, click \"the barest bones of my upcoming _Survivor_ page\":/survivor/index.php\n\nFor the skinny on how it's all done, click over or scroll down to the errata."
    extended: "I'm developing a database for my upcoming Survivor Game, and rather than spend any unnecessary time in Photoshop I want to have PHP generate all my cast pics on the fly. I downloaded the photos from SurvivorNews.net, and found that while they're all decent size and quality, they're compositionally quite different, such that Amber's head is about 100 pixels tall while Rudy's is about 250 -- in web terms, the difference between a watermelon and a Hummer.\n\nWhat I needed was a way to tell PHP how to reduce these rectangular glamour shots into square head shots, taking into consideration the fact that the Survivors' heads are all different sizes and positioned at different points on the same 375x200 space. I knew that the finished images would be no larger than 85 pixels square; for quality's sake I wanted the source images to be at least that big.\n\nImageCopy, which does pretty much what it sounds like, needs a few pieces of information in order to work. For our purposes, it needs the x/y coordinates of the source image at which to start copying, and the height and width of the area it's supposed to copy.\n\nI went into Photoshop and, using the Marquee tool, framed a square headshot for each Survivor. I then wrote down the x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of my frame, as well as the width of the square. Repeat 18 times. Get a soda.\n\nHaving gotten my framing information, I switched over to phpMyAdmin, and created a new field in the table I'm using for image data storage called _thumb_dimensions_. Into that field I typed in my instructions, in a format something like this:\n\nbq. _starting point x_, _starting point y_, _height_, _width_\n\nThen, in the PHP script which takes the image data and dumps it to the browser in the form of a spiffy new PNG image, I wrote in code that broke those instructions down to their component parts, and inserted them into their respective slots in ImageCopy.\n\nThen, having cropped the pictures with surprising accuracy, the script sizes them down to 85 pixels, applies a frame and goes to lunch.\n\nThe advantage to this is that using just one set of source images, I can potentially create endless different variations just by entering a short text string."

But there are enough improvements to warrant paying for the software, and no bugs so horrible that they make the former Kung-Log anything but a joy to use.\n\nThe new version uses a Safari-style brushed metal user interface, with tabs and extra drawers to move some of K-L's harder-to-use features (categorization, for one) into the spotlight. One thing I love that you can see on my \"screenshot\":http://practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/ecto-screenshot-full.jpg is that ecto now can be told not to let you post if you haven't assigned a category, or written a summary for this post.\n\nIt also has an account setup wizard that helps you quickly and easily set up ecto to access your blog, and now supports Six Apart's TypePad blogging service.\n\nFor a quick summary of cool new features and minor quibbles, click over to the errata page."
    extended: "Best new features:\n\n* Can tell ecto to require categories/summary via the preference panel\n* Allows editing of the date field, and even has a reset button so the date on an older entry can be reset to right now\n* Can customize the number of older entries you can load and edit, allowing ecto to access more than just the ten entries K-Log supported\n* WebKit-based preview, which doesn't do much for me given that I use the Textile plugin for my formatting, but is a nice extra touch\n\nMy few pet peeves:\n\n* Extended entry and summary are now in a separate tab, and keywords are now in _yet another_ tab. For most users, this will be a welcome change. For me, it adds some slightly unnecessary clicking. But I agree with this change on principle, and I'm sure I'll get used to it.\n* Keyboard shortcuts have been changed and many preference settings have been moved -- all the Kung-Log functionality is here, but I have to go looking for it, and I can no longer hit Command-Shift-U to upload an image.\n* I've previously expressed \"my dislike of the brushed metal\":http://practicalmadness.com/moleskine/arch/2003/07/we_cannot_abide_the_brushed_metal, which I feel should be restricted to browser-style apps, and not used for text editors. That said, brushed metal doesn't feel so out of place in Panther, and Adriaan uses it to very nice effect. I'll live."

    body: "I've gone and done it: the original weblog and the current Moleskine blog have been merged into one big blog. What does this have to do with the price of rice, you ask? Nothing, unless the price of rice is somehow keyed into the number of entries extant on Moleskine, in which case you can eat cake.\n\nTo find out how it's done, check out the notes section.\n\n*Also:*\n\n* I've begun working on decrufting my URLs. Expect permalinks to change without warning this weekend as I refine my site structure; \"the homepage\":/ will be your most reliable source for content, and everything should be stable by Monday.\n* Individual entry pages now have comment forms. Yay.\n* Yes, I know category links (\"...which is part of Web Arcana, which is part of...\") don't work. I'm working on it."
    extended: "Incidentally, if you were wondering how it's possible to merge together two (or more) Movable Type blogs, I will tell you.\n\nFirst, this will only work if your MT installation uses MySQL for its database. If you're still using the file-based BerkeleyDB that ships with MT, you may still be able to merge two blogs but bugger all if I can tell you how to do it.\n\nSecondly, be advised: while this will not affect any of your current blog pages, this will potentially break lots of permalinks. Personally I think permalinks are overrated, as the Web is a fluid medium and one should never be required to maintain a crufty URL structure just to be neighborly. Of course, that's easy for me to say -- I don't have a readership, and Google will have the new links indexed in less than a month.\n\nFinally, this does require that you, you know, _use_ the MySQL server for something besides Movable Type, and have some way of logging into it to run a query. Most likely, if you know enough about your server to have installed MT with MySQL support, you know how to do this.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n* Whatever means you use to update your MySQL database (command line, phpMyAdmin, whatever), open it up and log in.\n* Switch into the database used for MT.\n* Browse the table called _mt_blog_. You'll need to find out what the _blog_id_ field is for both the blog you're exporting _from_ and the one you're exporting _to_.\n* Run the following queries:\n** UPDATE mt_entry SET entry_blog_id = '_new blog id_' WHERE entry_blog_id = '_old blog id_'\n** UPDATE mt_category SET category_blog_id = '_new blog id_' WHERE category_blog_id = '_old blog id_'\n** UPDATE mt_placement SET placement_blog_id = '_new blog id_' WHERE placement_blog_id = '_old blog id_'\n** UPDATE mt_comment SET comment_blog_id = '_new blog id_' WHERE comment_blog_id = '_old blog id_'\n* Log into Movable Type in your browser and rebuild your site. Before doing this, you may want to click Edit Entries and make sure everything is in its right place.\n\nThis will move not only your entries, but their category placement and comments, and ensure that nothing breaks during the transition.\n\nFor my next little project, I'll be looking into how to do the reverse. But first, I need to eat banana pudding."

The greatest American film director of all time is Woody Allen. The guy has made more masterpieces then I have fingers (Hollywood Ending, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, and Small Time Crooks are the first that come to mind)and Fellini throughout his entire career tried to live up to Allen, tried to be like him, but failed miserably. Fellini should have stuck to action pictures; he is a strong director visually but he can't tell a simple story or make you feel for his characters like the Wood-man can. His films were always in Allen's shadow. Now I didn't see this movie but I read the summary of it, and it sure sounds boring. But I'll give it two stars just because I feel bad for the old coot. \n\nA brief explanation of why this is funny, for those who don't already get it:\n\n* Woody Allen's first movie was made in 1967. Most of Fellini's masterworks -- _La Strada_, _Nights of Cabiria_, _8 1/2_, to name a few -- were made well before then, and certainly before _Annie Hall_ put Allen on the map in the U.S.\n* The Allen films mentioned are quite possibly the worst he has ever made. All of them are released since 2000, and don't come anywhere near the greatness of the aforementioned _Annie Hall_ (1977), _Hannah and Her Sisters_ (1986) or _Crimes and Misdemeanors_ (1989). Again, just to name a few.\n* Action pictures? _Action_ pictures, Gracie???\n\nI do believe this is someone's idea of a joke, although I'd like to believe that if they had spent that much time watching Woody Allen (or Fellini, for that matter) they'd come off not so much as a dumbass."

It is saved as a PDF file with a transparent background, making the icon perfect for use in Photoshop.\n\nHow to do it:\n\n# Make sure the icon you want to capture is in the Dock\n# Press Command-Shift-4 on your keyboard. The cursor should change into a crosshair.\n# Press the spacebar. The cursor should change into a camera, and any window you hover over should turn blue.\n# Hover your mouse over the icon you want to steal. It should turn blue.\n# Click.\n\nYou should hear a camera-shutter sound effect. You're done. There is now a new _Picture X.pdf_ file on your Desktop, where _x_ is a sequential number based on however many of those you have there already.\n\nWe take this opportunity to remind all readers that stealing and misappropriating other people/companies' intellectual property is very, very bad and wrong and did we mention bad?

This includes Ridley Scott's not-so-aptly-named \"director's cut\" edition of _Alien_ released to theaters in October, which I had put off watching until tonight.\n\nFor my money the single most significant change is the reinstatement of a deleted scene where Ripley finds out what happened to Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), which in the new cut happens just after she's set the ship to self-destruct. The alien didn't kill them, but started to set up a hive and cocooned them. She looks up to see Dallas still alive, and he moans, \"kiiiilll...meeee...\" So she uses her handy flamethrower to roast them and go about her business.\n\nThe idea that Dallas and Brett have just been trapped in the bowels of the ship for the whole movie adds a degree of pathos, and reinforces the idea that what the alien does is a fate worse than death. However, its inclusion is made problematic by the expansion of the alien mythology in the next few movies, where it is revealed that alien eggs are laid by a queen, and so a single \"warrior\" alien acting alone has no reason to take prisoners if it has no queen and no access to facehuggers.\n\np{text-align: center}. <img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/alien_cocoons.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe scene in _Alien_ is, actually, truer to H.R. Giger's work than to the far less interesting sci-fi treatment in the next movie; the commentary track by Scott seems to indicate that Dallas and Brett are being _turned into eggs_, through some concept of insectoid sexuality that is far too risque and European for the King of the World, whose take on the aliens is only just barely harder-edged than a Spielberg movie.\n\nThis is backed up by the previous scene where, rather than use its tongue-mouth to eat Veronica Cartwright's brains, it slides its rather phallic tail around and up her leg, implying some kind of alien rape.\n\nObviously, a movie where the alien mates with Tom Skerritt and Harry Dean Stanton, then rapes Veronica Cartwright, is not going to be sequelized in _this_country. The alien can burst out of someone's chest and then kill five people, but it can't possibly be allowed to have sex.\n\nUnless, of course, the majority of moviegoers who saw this scene (hypothetically in 1979, or for real in the 2003 cut) didn't quite understand what was going on (as I didn't right away), or try to explain it in the context of Cameron's later, safer version of the nasties.\n\nAt any rate, the scene was cut for pacing reasons."

    body: "Here at Practicalmadness we have long struggled with the expectation that our products (specifically, madness) should be semantically valid, structured and tagged up the ass with metadata. That we need categories, and taxonomies, and syndicatory world-domination scenarios. That we need _content_.\n\nIn the 21st century, \"where's the beef?\" has been replaced by \"where's the content?\" That word again: On the (blogged) web, _content_ has replaced _writing_, _music_, _art_, _image_, _expression_, _media_.\n\nThe difference between these things (which exist in the real world) and internet _content_ is metadata, and the idea that a thing is somehow less real unless it can be categorized, referenced and described, rated, dated, searched and indexed.\n\nThis is a little scary. What this means is that an appreciation for the crafting of actual art, true expression, is dying out among certain connected individuals. It's like in tenth grade when a teacher told me I had to rework a painting just because there were fifteen minutes left in class and she couldn't have me not work.\n\nIt's connected, somewhat, in my mind with a description of \"a book recommended on Paul Bausch's weblog\":http://www.onfocus.com/index.asp?xml=2003_12_01_past.xml#3374, about  the ways television makes all culture trivial.\n\nSee, I've been trying to explain to my mother (and myself) why CNN's slide into utter ridiculousness doesn't represent a conspiracy by the Powers That Be to keep information from the people, but rather a natural attrition resulting from the people's demand for more, not necessarily better, information.\n\nThat is exactly the problem with the web: there is a huge impetus to _create content_, but no understanding of what makes particular items worthy of writing, reading and disseminating. There can be no Great Editor to filter in terms of subjective quality. There is only Google and technologies like it, which judge posts by their links to other sites, by their freshness, by the number of comments. By metadata.\n\nIn short, the urge to metadata-ize everything is the blogosphere's way of paying tribute to their god-head, the almighty Google -- instead of improving the technology to index the content, we're marking up the content to improve the index.\n\nThis is crazy. Perhaps what's needed is a period of blogfasting (Ooh! I coined a new term with blog in it!), where bloggers quit reading other blogs _but_ continue to blog themselves. I'd be really interested to see what happens when such talented writers are forced to _look at_ the world rather than simply process it.\n\nIncidentally, this entry was inspired by \"Metadata overfizzle\":http://www.kottke.org/03/12/metadazzle-overfizzle at Kottke, which tackles the subject far more snarkily than I ever could."

About the moblog\n\nIf you've visited the homepage, you've seen those lovely drop-shadowed photos that constitute my \"moblog\":/moblog.php. _What is a moblog?_, you ask. It's short for _mobile blog_, which is even shorter for _mobile weblog_, which is even shorter for _mobile continuous virtual masturbation consisting mostly of grainy, low-res photographs taken by a fabulous new phonecam, and posted here out of a desire to be loved_.\n\nThe moblog exists to -educate and- entertain myself -and others-. While it is not currently possible to see larger versions of these pictures or read snarky captions for them, such a thing is certainly within the realm of possibility, and will be realized soon.\n\nDo not taunt Happy Fun Ball.\n\nh2. About that right margin\n\nWindows IE users may have decided that I don't know shit about web design from the way that the right margin of my pages keeps, well, collapsing into itself. Please, stop holding your breath. That shade of purple is unpleasant.\n\nThis is yet another way that Windows IE defies the will of the CSS gods, by refusing to implement the _width_ property for the _BODY_ tag. In English This Means: I had written a stylesheet which limited the width of a given page to ~625px (less on blog pages), a rule which WinIE is breaking. Right now. As we speak.\n\nI can and will fix it. And then I will seek my rightful and divine justice upon Microsoft for breaking my loveliest of pages. I will _GOOP THEM_, my precious.\n\nAdditionally, the lovely list-item icons I've been using do show up in WinIE...right next to an ugly-ass HTML bullet. Oh, our revenge will be had. Comeuppance will be ours!"

So far even those countries who didn't sign up for the Coalition of the Willing To Believe Anything have joined the applause.\n\nAt the same time, some people are concerned that this one triumph will overshadow the otherwise breathtaking failure of the U.S. misadventure in Iraq, which will help to re-elect President Bush for another four years of this kind of crap.\n\nbq. *Argument:* Bush has ruined our economy, gutted Medicare, banned partial-birth abortions (which, stop me if I'm wrong, have typically been done only if the mother's life is in danger), ruined our diplomatic relations with the rest of the world (including the 99.7% of the UK that isn't Tony Blair) and gotten American soldiers involved in a guerilla war that will escalate into a full-scale civil war as soon as Halliburton's done helping themselves to all the Iraqi oil they want and we leave.\n\nbq. *Rebuttal:* But we got Saddam!\n\nAnd the truly amazing thing is that for many Americans, this is good enough -- they accept the rebuttal. More importantly, they accept the Republican idea that the question is, \"do the ends justify the means?\" E.g.: If the ends were justified, the means were justified, which can (for the sake of argument) include every aspect of Administration policy since 9/11. It is possible for the ends to be totally justified and the means to be totally wrong, at the same time, so long as the argument can be made that there was a better way to do it.\n\nOh! And just to make this whole business even more funny, some officials/commentators/really stupid people are suggesting that now that we have Saddam, maybe _he_ knows where the WMDs are hidden!"

    body: "After a couple previous attempts to frame the following thought in some kind of witty, introspective commentary, I've distilled it into a single selfish idea:\n\nbq. My friends haven't called, e-mailed, text-messaged or IMmed in over a week, and I start to feel like I don't exist.\n\nA couple hundred bucks'[1] worth of therapy has -taught- begun to teach me that it's okay to just start a conversation with people. After so many years of avoiding the issue or blaming the world, my family, God, etc., I applied my vast intellect to the problem and started to wonder how relationships start, anyway. How did mine start?\n\nDuh -- with one unsolicited conversation, that leads to a second solicited one, and so on and so forth. So obviously, to feel like you can't talk to people who aren't already in your circle -- to wait for someone's devoted attention -- is like waiting until you're underwater to breathe.\n\nConcordantly, I have flirted with Laura Bonds, gone out drinking with some co-workers and had a good time. This human contact, it's intoxicating. I want more.\n\nMy conversations at work aren't always fulfilling. A mention of the midnight showings of _The Return of the King_ prompted a cute girl I work with to bring up the topic of the relative merits of _The Two Towers_ novel and film. I should tattoo onto my forehead and post around my home (in needlepoint) the following axiom:\n\nbq{font-weight: bold}. NOTE TO SELF: IF YOU WANT TO APPEAR CHARMING AND INTELLIGENT, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISCUSS TOLKIEN WITH SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY LIKES THE BOOKS.\n\nReally, what I need to find is a crowd that likes movies (especially auteurist Hollywood, Western European and Japanese cinema) and web development, and has an appreciation for acid wit. I miss those mornings in high school when I could show off my latest frameset-laden concoction and get comments from guys who knew what the hell they were looking at.\n\nHow do I flirt? How do I feel people out? My interests are not particularly narrow, but they can be narrowly focused in the moment. When I'm in _Survivor_ mode, it's hard to make me discuss movies with the same vigor, and vice versa. And my web development projects are the worst: I'll spend all day refining code in my head, and so I end up embarrassing myself by showing off my moblogging app like it's a new baby to someone who doesn't know what it does.[2]\n\nI'm getting better, but being stuck here is a little bit hard."
    extended: "fn1. Co-pays only. And it's going to stop here, because I'm firing my therapist on Tuesday. It was a good thing in the beginning, but it gets less cathartic as my Prozac kicks in, and he called me five times at work. That's not cool.\n\nfn2. Granted, what I had to show off wasn't too visually impressive. It was the WAP page I use to move moblog photos from my mail server to MySQL. I look at it and see the successful movement of binary data from an IMAP server to a database entry, which (potentially) will be used to generate those lovely drop-shadowed thumbnails on the homepage. I see beauty.\n\nJackie at work looks at it and sees a link that says \"Load Moblog (0/2)\". I click on it, the screen goes blank for a few seconds, and when it comes back it looks identical except that the link has changed to \"Load Moblog (0/1)\". Looking at it that way, I think I understand her confusion."

    body: "With the able assistance of Tilted Planet uber-tech James, this site has been upgraded. We are now located on a server running PHP 4.3.3, with the GD2 graphics extension, both upgraded from what was running before. What this geekery means is that my latest evil scheme(tm) is at hand: a moblog.\n\nIt's really rather a mophotoblog, which is (I think) apropos considering its launch during the Ramahanukwanzmas season.[1] Six months ago, back in the dark days of my former hosting provider, I had an online photo album called Thousand Words, which had to come offline because it relied on GD2 to display pictures. Now that GD2's back, I can relaunch it.\n\nBut will I stop there? Of course not!\nDo I have anything better to do? Of course not!\n\nI now have the capability to add photos to Thousand Words's database simply by e-mailing them. This is somewhat more user-friendly than the old method (which involved a web form and a sacrifice to certain blood deities), and also allows me to add photos taken with my cameraphone without the intermediate step of, you know, coming home.\n\nAs an extra added attraction, all of my photos will now be stamped with the Practical logo, and all come with a free Frogurt.[2]"

Expect a film version (starring Tim Allen as Joe and Colin Farrell as David) in theaters in time for Oscar consideration next fall.\n\nfn2. The Frogurt is also cursed. Please call your blood deity for assistance."

They're an L.A.-based indie bookstore/publisher with a great website featuring thoughtful recommendations and a nice, eclectic selection. However, what moved me from passive admirer to active buyer was the description of their packaging:\n\nbq. your books will arrive in the mail wrapped in our signature kraft paper, hand-stamped with our logo, and tied with a lovely piece of twine\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened. I bought a copy of _Schott's Original Miscellany_, a book of utter trivia (\"International paper sizes, WWII postal acronyms, types of murder\") that sounded good both as reading for me or as a gift for someone else. Furthermore, it's a total _book_ book, which I would read not for a story or directed learning but rather for the rather fidgety action of _reading_ a _book_.\n\nOh, but the wrapping. The description doesn't do justice to the lo-fi brilliance that is this packaging. For starters, First Cut doesn't settle for the thin, lame Home Depot twine -- they went all-out for the raggedy, character-laden old-school twine. Tucked into the twine are three cards, all on speckled, natural-looking paper. One is embossed with First Cut's logo, and is (I guess) a bookmark. One is their business card. And the last is a handwritten note from the owner thanking me for my order.\n\nIt is such a lovely work of art, this packaging, that it's going to take me a while to build up the courage to rip it up so I can read the book.\n\nSee, I'm a sucker for a well-thought-out package. In much the same way that clothes make the man, the way something is packaged says a lot about how it's supposed to be received. And this sort of packaging gives the object a human element -- someone paid this much attention, this much _respect_ to this book, and so it must be something special.\n\nThis viewpoint, incidentally, informs a lot of what I do. I'm a conoisseur of DVD design: I admire discs whose packaging and menus aspire to being more than just promotional art, with Criterion being the gold standard in elegant, evocative menu design and packaging.\n\nI think a good package needs those two qualities. It should be elegant, in the sense that it makes an impression without upstaging its contents, and evocative in the same way that the handwritten note and careful wrapping show the emotional attachment between the people who sold me this book and the book itself."

Do they just float out there for all eternity? What would happen if some ship just happened to run into the alien from the first movie, and it grabbed hold of their hull like the gremlin from that episode of _The Twilight Zone_?\n\nThinking of this, I find a new admiration for the bastard children of the _Alien_ franchise, the third and fourth movies, because even _Aliens_ -- which raised the ante for the series in every other way -- had to resort to the old \"blow the alien out the airlock\" trick for an ending. Granted, James Cameron saw Ridley Scott's airlock and raised him a little girl, an android and a power loader, but still.\n\nI have a confession: I actually like _Alien 3_ and _Alien Resurrection_. They're deeply flawed movies, and _Alien 3_ gets a little worse every time I see it, but in them you get all the benefit of some really visionary directors given their first big break in Hollywood to make a b-movie about monsters with acid for blood. It's like the prototypical Hollywood situation: you've made your name making smaller, artful, more adult work, and now it's time to debut onto the world stage. So what do they offer you but the standard monsters-with-acid-for-blood movie?\n\nAnd I love how each movie covers a totally different genre, so that you can have both a classical horror movie (the original) and a somewhat campy adventure movie (_Resurrection_), and they're all more or less valid takes on the franchise."

    body: "<img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/moleskine/images/picture(4).jpg\" height=\"352\" width=\"288\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px\" />Today would be only the second time I've tried surviving Best Buy's early morning, day-after-Thanksgiving sale, and it came off pretty much as I expected. The best deal in the place (if you're not a _Lion King_ fan) involved a \$60 instant rebate on SanDisk flash memory cards; I picked one up for my Canon digicam, which as a result can now hold some 250 photos saved at the highest quality setting.\n\nOf course, several DVDs and CDs were on sale, but given the choice between _The Lion King: The Version You've Never Seen_ for \$12 (sale price) and _Mulholland Drive_ for \$10 (regular price), I think you know which one I picked.\n\nThe last time I tried this, three Christmases ago in Chicago, there was the usual assortment of low-end goodies for cheap (although the off-brand DVD players were about a hundred bucks more expensive then than now), but they also had every CD in the store on sale for \$9, which is how I got into Aimee Mann. This year no such luck. Then again, the two or three CDs I'm most interested in having right now aren't stocked by the yellow monster anyway, so it's all academic.\n\nI spent about as much time in line to buy stuff as I did shopping. The line started about fifty feet away from checkout, then wrapped around the perimeter of the store, through home theater, appliances, car audio and video games. One knew where to start by looking for the elfin gentleman with stars taped to his butt.\n\nI passed the time by irritating family and friends alike with e-mails and photos from my new mobile phone, like the one above, taken as the long march to freedom passed through the refrigerator aisle."

    body: "Sometimes a million trillion people really _can't_ be wrong: Amazon.com's music recommendations have come through for me again, suggesting I try out Neutral Milk Hotel and The Decemberists, which sound very much alike and yet quite pleasing to these ears. My goal is eventually to become quite into a band that none of my friends have heard of, a pathetic game of one-upspersonship to see who can be the most pious hipster.\n\nAt the same time, however, we must indulge in guilty pleasures: songs by Britney Spears and OutKast found their way into my library this week, and haven't yet been voted out. The latter was because Thom Yorke told some magazine somewhere that \"Hey Ya!\" was the single of the year (and you know what, it really is); the former because the song in question -- \"Early Mornin'\" -- was produced by Moby and sounds more like a Moby song with Britney doing a guest appearance than the other way around.\n\nBut the truest guilty pleasure is one I've finally figured out: Dido. A surprising number of sophisticated listeners of harder-edged music listen to Dido, and I think it's the Astrud Gilberto thing. Her music is literate (I don't know too many other people who can squeeze the word 'desolate' into a pop song) and non-threatening. What's more, she's cool-voiced (see also Gilberto, Nico, et al) so even the most insipid pop song loses that treacly feeling you'd get if, say, it were being sung by Celine Dion. She's a guilty pleasure, but an understandable one.\n\nAnd now, the plausible deniability."

Why do you need a picture phone? You can only send pictures to other people who have them.\n\nFirst, some background: I've taken the cellphone plunge and ordered a Sony Ericsson T610 from T-Mobile by way of Amazon.com, taking advantage of an offered \$100 rebate and free Bluetooth headset.\n\nWhy choose this phone, of all phones? The simple, most important reason: it's the best-looking one on the market right now. I actually would prefer the T68i for looks, and said so to a T-Mobile sales rep at the mall, but was advised against it -- it would cost me as much (or more) as the T610, which has more features and a better display.\n\nAnd in fact, my dream phone of all phones is an Ericsson T610 in _volcanic red_, which is available in Europe but not currently in the U.S. Whatever -- all the other phones I looked at were fugly, and this one (regardless of color) is not.\n\nBut anyway, Mary does raise a very important issue: what the hell does one do with a cameraphone?\n\nFor starters, as I told her, you're not really limited to other people with cameraphones.[1] What I'm really after is moblogging -- using my phone's camera to post images to Practical from anywhere in town.\n\nSee, cause I already have a digital camera, and not a bad one. But its storage is limited, and do I really need two whole megapixels just for a snapshot of a funny mannequin on NoMi? No.\n\nWhereas I could set up a bunch of e-mail aliases on this server, one for things I definitely want to post now and one for things I want to look at before posting, and write some scripts that automatically grab images from my mailbox and put them (for example) into a MySQL table. Voila.\n\nSo it's a programming project, and an art project, and just a cool toy. And you know, there are \"benefits to networked photo storage\":http://www.cheesebikini.com/archives/000901.html that are really worth exploring."

You've pretty much single-handedly revived _Survivor_ as a TV franchise: the current _Pearl Islands_ edition, on which you were a contestant, is the highest-rated since the original series in 2000, which didn't have to worry about airing opposite _Friends_.\n\nYou've been such a dominant player that next Spring you'll be the only person from _Pearl Islands_ to appear on _Survivor: All-Star_, playing with past winners and MVPs, most of whom placed higher in the game than you did. Your prize money from _Pearl Islands_ is probably at least \$25,000; even if you were to be voted out _first_ on _All-Star_, you get another \$25,000, because of the higher prize pool on that show.\n\nSo bearing in mind that you'll be at least \$25,000 richer as a result of having been on _Survivor_, why were you whining about your \"dreams\" after you were voted out tonight? And how could you expect anyone to care about your dreams enough to sacrifice their own?\n\nYou knew you were the dominant force in a game for a million dollars, and yet you looked totally shocked that anyone would dare vote you off. Did it never occur to you that Burton, et al., would seize the opportunity to claim that fortune for themselves?\n\nGranted, you're an emotional guy -- that's why we love to watch you. At best, you could be the most lovable Survivor, well, ever. At worst, we get spectacles like your rampage after nearly getting voted off three weeks ago, and tonight's final words. I mean, come on -- it's not like you're helpless, dude.\n\nAnd it's not like you can go around _telling_ everyone that they're gonna fare no better than second place and not expect someone to fight back. It's like giving someone one chocolate chip and asking that they sit there while you finish off the whole cookie.\n\nAnd guess what -- it's a _game_. If you beat them fairly, they won't begrudge you for it. You got beaten, and it wasn't about not being accepted into the group (they loved you, for chrissakes) or denying you your dreams -- you got outwitted, outplayed and outlasted. Deal with it."

Absolut isn't even my favorite vodka, per se, but it has sentimental value for me: Justin, my old college roommate, papered our walls with nothing but Absolut ads ripped out of magazines, and was always on the look for good new ones. (Ironically, the one thing Absolut-related _not_ to be found in that room was a bottle of Absolut.)\n\nAnyway, the photo is of the \"Absolut 5\" gift set I bought at the ABC Beverage store in Hoover yesterday, which has airline-size bottles of the stuff in five yummy flavors. Actually, it's more like three confirmed yummy flavors and two I still haven't tried. But now I can, without buying a fifth bottle I'll never finish.\n\nNow, I do wonder why they couldn't have included Absolut Kurant (currant-flavored vodka), made it a six-bottle set in a slightly ritzier package. But that's a small thing, valuable only as a way of distracting myself from the fact that I just paid \$10 to get my hands on a tiny bottle of Absolut Vanilia."

No word yet on Ted's fares or Ted's on-time ratings, or whether you'll get through TSA any faster by saying, \"ahem, I'm flying with Ted.\" Also not known is whether there are any plans to rename the United Terminal at O'Hare \"Ted's House\", although I would certainly recommend it."

    body: "CNN.com has a story about <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/11/12/university.censorship.ap/index.html\">a little debacle between Hampton University and the American Society of Newspaper Editors</a>, the latter of which has decided to rescind a journalism grant to the former after university administrators reacted poorly to the school newspaper's decision _not_ to give front-page treatment to a letter from the university president.\n\nWhat struck me was this last paragraph:\n\nbq. The student staff later agreed to run a reprinted issue of the Script featuring [university president Dr. JoAnn] Haysbert's letter on the cover in exchange for the formation of a task force to examine the future of the newspaper.\n\nSo the deal to continue publication is that they had to concede defeat in the battle over editorial control of their front page, reprint an entire issue (whose budget is paying for that, by the way?) and in exchange for this _a task force_ is being formed to examine the future of the newspaper.\n\nWhose task force? Is it a student task force that will work to ensure that future newspaper staffers will operate without fear of reprisal by the administration? Or is the function of this task force to ensure that the proper relationship between staff and administration is established, or some other euphemism for continued censorship?\n\nThe most amazing part: the scandal is over a story about the _school cafeteria._ Granted, there were health violations at the school cafeteria, but CNN's piece indicates that the front-page story that replaced Haysbert's letter said pretty much the same thing: that progress was being made in fixing problems in the cafeteria.\n\nSo this is just a big, dumb ego trip on somebody's part.\n\n*Update:* Plastic has an \"executive summary of the whole sad, strange business\":http://www.plastic.com/article.html;sid=03/11/13/19514124. Unlike CNN's piece, Plastic contributor MAYORBOB had no qualms about mentioning the university's \"task force\" with eyebrows askance, and clarified that president JoAnn Haysbert's letter was not merely commenting upon the progress in the cafeteria's health problems, but criticizing the media coverage of same."

    body: "Now that CNN has been outed regarding the whole Mac/PC question during the Rock The Vote debate last week, they have fessed up and today \"issued an apology\":http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/11/12/cnn/index.php?redirect=1068620063000, saying that a producer on the show \"went too far\" in telling Brown University student Alexandra Trustman what question to ask.\n\nbq. Trustman said that she was \"confused by the question's relevance\" and would have preferred instead to ask the candidates about how they'd use technology in their administrations. She was told by the CNN producer that her question \"wasn't lighthearted enough\" and that they wanted to \"modulate the event with various types of questions.\"\n\nbq. \"In an attempt to encourage a lighthearted moment in this debate, a CNN producer working with Ms. Trustman clearly went too far. All of the other questions from the audience originated from the person asking them,\" said CNN spokeswoman Christa Robinson.\n\nIf anyone from CNN just happens to be reading, let me explain something: if you feel you have to engineer a lighthearted moment in a _presidential debate_, then the terrorists are probably right, and we probably deserve it. CNN made their reputation as a credible news source; to me this incident ranks right up there with the Jayson Blair/Rick Moody stuff at the _NY Times_.\n\nThere's a place for storytelling, a place for opinion and a place for the straight truth -- you know, the news. CNN seems to believe that those things can all coexist at the same time and place."

    body: "p{font-style: italic}. \"I am calm and centered. I enjoy giving milk.\" -- Brainwashed cow\n\nI've been taking Prozac again since Saturday, after my new, company-subsidized psychiatrist decided that what was good for high school stress relief may as well be good for everything else.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how much more balanced I feel with just a few doses. This is almost certainly the placebo effect, since Prozac takes about four weeks to reach theraputic levels in the bloodstream.\n\nHowever, what if it's not? If I'm that much more calm and centered from even a tiny dose of the stuff, how much better will I feel in two weeks? And will I feel like a doped-up zombie in four weeks?\n\nThen again, given last night's bout with experimental prose, perhaps the calm I'm feeling is just an illusion -- something I want to be true rather than actual calmness.\n\nShall I measure my mental strength by my ability to accept a world that has Burberry plaid in it? Yes, precious, I think I shall."

    body: "I've been ranting for days now that someone (like my mother) who gets their news only from CNN is seeing an extremely filtered, limited picture of what's going on in the world. This is not to say that CNN is biased _per se_; they're certainly no Fox News in this respect. It's more that everything on CNN has been primped and pimped for maximum feel-good value.\n\nMy mother had noticed that while conservative pundits like Ann Coulter and Robert Novak are treated with respect and dignity, she says liberals like filmmaker/activist Michael Moore and musician/activist Moby are practically laughed off the tube. It took me, like, 0.3 seconds to realize the difference: looks. Coulter, Novak, Tucker Carlson and their ilk are dressed for business, in suits and respectable hair. They're also thoroughly WASPy.\n\nWith the possible exception of the Oscars, I have never seen Michael Moore with his collar buttoned. He always has several days' scraggly beard growth, because that's part of his image as a semi-grungy middle-American bohemian. And Moby usually appears in a t-shirt, because that's part of his image as a rock star.\n\nWhen they appear on CNN to espouse a viewpoint, the reaction has nothing to do with what they are saying. They could be making those 'wah-wah' sounds the grown-ups on Charlie Brown cartoons made. The people in the suits are laughing at these cute little men in casual clothes with their naive viewpoints. That's all: business versus casual. Serious versus unserious.\n\nIt's all a show, you see. As was that Democratic presidential debate last week, where <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/11/cnn_planted_question_at_debate_student_says/\">CNN tampered with the proceedings</a> by asking a student to abandon her prepared, pointed question and ask the candidates whether they preferred PCs or Macs. If someone was paying them for product placement, I hope it was Microsoft: nearly every candidate said they were a Windows user.\n\nI now see no reason to believe anything I hear on CNN. Again I grant that everything they report is ostensibly true, but represents a limited version of that truth designed to satisfy like nickel theater."

    body: "<img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/mac/images/crappy_cs_icons.jpg\" height=\"152\" width=\"389\" align=\"\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" longdesc=\"\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.0em\" />\n\nI hate those icons. I hate them so much.\n\nWhat mental-deficient at Adobe decided that the classic Photoshop logo -- an eye, in recent versions one looking through a camera filter -- needed to be replaced by a fucking _feather_? See, I always saw _an eye_ and _a filter_ and thought, gee: eye? Filter? Camera! Photoshop! Now I'm like, birds? What the fuck do I do with birds???\n\nAdobe's CS series has many welcome improvements. I'm loving the pixel aspect correction in Photoshop, because now I can design video titles and DVD menus without having to remember to do the math and resize when I'm done. (They even include title safe guides in new documents for video, which puts my title safe template out of work.) I wish Filter Layers had survived the beta process, but I guess that's just something we'll have to save for Photoshop 9.\n\nHere I am mostly annoyed by Adobe's psychopathic marketing department. I'm okay with the idea of the Creative Suite, but why rename all the apps after it? Why change all the icons from images that evoke their functions to nonsensical abstract imagery?\n\nWhen Microsoft decided to make the Office icons show some brand identity, they did change them all to a similar format: on Windows, they're color-coded boxes containing the traditional, never-changing icon for the app. Word is still a typeset W, Excel is still a very chart-like X. Powerpoint is still a slide. And you know, even on the Mac, the icons make some sense. They are similar, blob-like letters, color coded but all generally comprehensible. W is for Word, X is for Excel.\n\nNow Photoshop is a...feather? What the fuck?"

    body: "Having just received my \"Spring course schedule\":http://www.artic.edu/saic/new/cschedules/wisp04/coursedesc_wisp04.pdf (PDF) from those lovable clowns at \"SAIC\":http://www.artic.edu/saic/, I'm once again struck by what a blessing and a curse it has been to go to a pamby art school instead of, like, a _real_ university.\n\nI may not always agree with the politics of my institution, and some days I would literally kill for a straight-up, dead-white-male-favoring history class. But when my semester courseload is shaping up to include record production, food rituals and a Tuesday night screening series of the great Hollywood movies of the 70s as credit courses, I find I have difficulty complaining.\n\nThis is not to say that the Spring catalog is totally without art-school excess:\n\nbq. *Lust &#38; Aggression in Contemporary Art*\nUnlike desire which is about a kind of yearning, lust and aggression are about acquisition and invasion.  From the aggressive stalking projects of artist Sophie Calle to the lust thrust of zine-turned-magazine BUST to the consumer goals of American Girl Place, there has been a cultural shift in the ways lust and aggression are celebrated visually, particularly but not exclusively women's lust and aggression.  But what about aspects of lust and aggression that are not so easily visualized such as aggressive movements and hopes for political change?  What images are in the foreground, which are upstaged, what are the related economic issues and how can the traffic in images evolve toward a visual circulation that is radically democratic?\n\nWow. Whoever wrote that description can stretch out a sentence even better than I can. I tried using Summary Service on it and all I managed to strip out was the 50-page treatise on the Britney/Madonna kiss.\n\nA class about lust and aggression in contemporary media is a good idea; I'm just not sure that's exactly what this description is pitching. For one thing, it claims to be covering a shift in the way (particularly) women's lust and aggression are celebrated visually. Well, is it lust and aggression <em>toward</em> women, or their lust and aggression toward men? Or each other? Or material objects?\n\nWhen someone references American Girl Place as an exemplar of lust and aggression, it's a little bit unsettling, but not entirely inaccurate. Is this course about female identity, specifically the search for one of the prefab feminine mystiques peddled by the market and media? Possibly, but that's not lust.\n\nSo is it about agressive stalking by women? That can be related to lust, and certainly to aggression, but would you say that there has been a major sea change in the way female lust is represented in culture? It typically isn't -- the standing cultural trope is that women want safety and security vis-a-vis marriage, and that it is men who lust.\n\nThis is not to say that female lust hasn't come into the open far, far more than it ever has in the last 5-10 years -- these Gen Y girls are sexually aware, independent and aggressive. (And they're, like, 14!) So is that what the class is about? If so, what does that have to do with American Girl Place and economics?\n\nI think this is a classic case of a course description that perhaps doesn't really understand its focus as much as the teacher has a vague idea of a new cultural force, which I'm sure has been properly discussed and documented, and which I'm sure will make for a great class. I'm just saying that that class is probably nothing like what is described here.\n\nEnough debate. Time for McGriddles."

    body: "I just signed up (online, natch) for a new checking account with Bank of America, and am pleased to report that the process was smooth and easy as the cover of _Maxim_...except for the last, most important part: the signature form.\n\nAnyone who's ever opened a checking account knows how important the signature card is, and BofA's online system apparently uses a ColdFusion script to dynamically generate a PDF form that is already filled in with your name and account number, as well as some other pertinent details like which branch and sales rep opened the account.\n\nThis little detail -- that it's a ColdFusion script doing the dynamic form-makin' -- is something which, I'd imagine, is supposed to be transparent. However, when I clicked on the link to open the form, Safari started downloading what appears to be a page of ColdFusion-ready variables as a plain text document, but not the PDF.\n\nSo maybe this document -- despite its _.cfm_ file extension -- is supposed to be opened in Adobe Reader, so as to populate the form. Okay, let's try that. Nope.\n\nI'm stumped. Time to call customer service. Wait -- what's that you say? BofA's call center closes at 5PM Eastern? And it's 4:10 here in Alabama? Hmmmm. Let's try the \"Secure E-mail Form\" link on their support page. Clicking....aaaaand it's a blank page.\n\nHrrm. Ahem. Yes.\n\nAnd yet, considering that I was until recently a Citibank customer, this is probably still the best customer service experience I've ever had from a bank."

    title: "Direction"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "fn1. End All, Be All."
    body: "I've been thinking a lot about what I should do with this site, and I've come to a few conclusions. Some things constant in my ever-malleable thought process, you know, some things upon which all the voices in my head are in agreement.\n\n* I like Movable Type and Kung-Log as a CMS and posting tool, respectively.\n* Despite the legacy of Practicalmadness.com as a place where essays are published, the PHP-MySQL management system I've built for the 30-something pieces currently online is a piece of crap, and the scripts that serve them up are even worse. (More on this in a moment.)\n* I have no interest in blogging or the traditional weblog format as the end-all, be-all for this site.\n* I think the totally XHTML-based left navigation bar is beautiful and elegant, and currently more than a little unwieldy.\n* I like pie.\n\nSo following on some other recent thoughts, I'm considering a new approach: several loosely-connected blogs, the first of which being the \"Mac Idolatry\":http://www.practicalmadness.com/mac/ blog that I launched a day or two ago. The next would be a more focused version of the classic weblog, which is just a daily (or rather, monthly) musings sort of thing. And then, perhaps a political blog covering the democratic primaries and the latest Administration shenanigans.\n\nAnd then, maybe it'll snow corn flakes.\n\nh2. Organization\n\nMy biggest ongoing problem has been organization. The reason I'm thinking of these things as totally separate blogs, rather than just categories in MT, is because MT's categorization features suck. There needs to be support for a default category setting, I think. Currently, while every post is placed by date without any additional action from me, I have to set the category explicitly, and while I can hack together an Archive File Template that places uncategorized posts into an \"unfiled\" directory, this still breaks a whole lot of MT's built-in functionality regarding context and organization.\n\nLike, I think the archives tags should _always_ have a global scope. What I mean by this: on archive pages (as opposed to indexes) the current behavior when using tags to show a list of entries is to use only the current category. It _should_ be to show all entries, organized by date, just like on an Index Template -- it shouldn't assume context that may or may not be there, because my categories are more often simply not that relevant. This is an area where MT is putting up roadblocks where it should be helping me out.\n\nMT's categories are useful if an entire site is based around a single MT blog, which is most often the case. My inspiration for wanting to use multiple blogs is the fact that no matter how many different blogs you have, all my entries live in the same MySQL table, with only a numeric blog ID separating Mac Idolatry posts from Weblog ones. So the idea of separate blogs as separate sites is merely a conceit of MT's user interface; the databases are structured to allow much more versatility in how your data is used, although the application code dictates only a limited set of options, most of them stupid.\n\nIn fact, classic Movable Type _does_ support subcategorization, it just only goes one level deep and requires that you manage each root-level category as if it were a totally separate site. This is sloppy as all hell, but there are ways to deal with this. For example, there's the fact that I no longer use MT's template engine for anything but dumping content onto pages -- all my pages, sitewide, are put together using Smarty, which allows for instantaneous changes without a rebuild. So I could make a whole bunch o' MT blogs, all using the same basic templates-as-PHP files, all linked to the same Smarty template and all featuring navigation that keeps everything all unified and harmonious.\n\nSee, my site can be organized _in spite of_ Movable Type. Despite all my strongest urges to shove this blogging app up Ben &#38; Mena's pale white asses, one thing keeps me coming back: it's already written, if untamed."

    description: "While I'm on the subject of Windows, on a lark I decided to install the new AOL 9.0 Optimized on my laptop today and I must say, I'm impressed."
    body: "While I'm on the subject of Windows, on a lark I decided to install the new AOL 9.0 Optimized on my laptop today and I must say, I'm impressed. I'm still no fan of AOL's all-in-one approach to the internet, especially on Windows where everything has to be stuck inside one big, closed window, but 9.0's user interface is the nicest yet. I would go so far as to call it Mac-like.\n\nThe new version gives you more control than ever (read: any control at all) over what content you see on your AOL homepage, in the toolbar, etc. It has decent mail-management features that put it almost on par with full-featured e-mail clients like Outlook Express and Mozilla Mail, and finally AOL members have the option to store their messages locally. In lay terms this means that you no longer have to be signed in to your AOL account to read messages you've already recieved. This is a good thing.\n\nAOL's slick-but-dopey ad campaign to promote the 9.0 Optimized client (\"Life needs ____.\" An enema, perhaps?) is touting new spam filters and antivirus protection for the e-mail client; I don't get enough mail in my never-used AOL account to have noticed any change, but compared to the broken condom that was previous editions of the AOL client, I guess any news is good news.\n\nOne thing I don't like so much: there is an \"AOL companion\" that is launched when you start AOL 9.0, and floats on top of all your windows like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It's designed to provide some limited information and options for people who browse with their AOL software minimized, like how many new e-mails or IMs have been received and so forth. I'll allow that it's a good compromise between the full-screen AOL experience and nothing at all. But I was under the impression that most AOL users were still on that service _because_ of the all-in-one experience, and aren't as liable to need an extra toolbar. They may even find it confusing.\n\nThat's just a quibble. I really don't understand why AOL doesn't go to a multiple-window format (like their nice OS X client) on Windows, or why they still have a weird space in the title bar (\"America&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online\"), but with 9.0 Optimized AOL comes close to almost being a decent way to get online.\n\nNow cut the prices back to under \$20 a month and you might be worth talking to."

    title: "Letter from a candidate"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Practical's coverage of the Race From The White House kicks off with a facile dissection of last night's Democratic debate, _in which_ Dean is the new Nader."
    body: "Clark or Dean? Clark or Dean? That is the question, and as in the last Presidential election, \"none of the above\" is not an acceptable choice. CNN aired last night a debate between all nine current Presidential candidates, and I could finally see why Howard Dean, who is mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore, is the front-runner. No matter how many times Officer Kerry tried to get it back, he kept stealing the show.\n\nIn a field of nine people who are varying degrees of boring, Dean is like no politician I've seen in any recent election. Set aside for the moment that he actually seems to believe in what he's saying, and that he's able to deliver the lines with as passion as one of Gore's superior smirks. At this point he's an old hand at keeping his straight talk in line with his policy, and is willing to get in there and mix it up in a debate when (e.g.) someone compares him to Newt Gingrich.\n\nIt's almost enough to wish for a Kerry/Dean showdown for the nomination just to keep the barbs coming. You know what's funny? They have great chemistry on stage. They're like Felix and Oscar.[1] Neither one stand's a Heineken's chance in Hell of being elected President of the United States, and they're still up there insulting each other like it's personal or somethin'.\n\nh2. Yeah, you heard me right: no chance\n\nDean's take-no-prisoners enthusiasm almost makes a believer out of me, and I'll book my tickets to Canada with a smile on my face if I end up having to vote for him next November. But he committed the Deadly Sin of presidential politics last night: he dared to mention universal health care.\n\nIt's not that universal health care isn't a great thing, or that the fact that we're the only industrialized nation that doesn't have it[2] is a huge fucking embarrassment. It's a well-known tenet of Republican dogma that federalized universal health care is the ultimate big-government program, and thereby totally un-American. That the Republicans are trying to force through a massive expansion in the powers and role of federal law enforcement agencies in citizens' daily lives is apparently nothing approaching the same thing.\n\nThe government position on health care makes as much sense as the RIAA extorting \$2,500 from a 12-year-old girl because music piracy hurts the artists.[3] And yet, to defy that position will have the GOP calling any Democratic candidate not only wrong, but possibly insane. They will hammer Dean for espousing the position throughout the campaign. If elected, the GOP-controlled Congress will block any attempt to even introduce legislation to make it happen. And then they will hammer him for promising universal health care and not making it happen.\n\nIn this system, universal health care really is an impossible dream, useful only to those fish-faced enemies of the people who would use it as a poking stick.\n\nh2. All chiefs all the time\n\nAt the same time, however, I'm losing my faith in Gen. Wesley Clark's ability to pull it together in time to be anything besides an afterthought in this campaign, and the undecided public's ability to ignore the bashing he's getting from all eight of the other Democratic candidates, the entire GOP and most of the media. It's not that he's a bad candidate. It's that he's obviously a candidate in training.\n\nHe can get up on that stage and talk about America, and look very Presidential in doing so. But there are so many questions about him and his candidacy to which there can be no satisfactory answers. Like, how can he be running as a Democratic candidate if he's not even currently a registered Democrat? What, is he an opportunist or something? The simple answers, the one's Clark himself has given: because he opposes Bush, and no.\n\nThe thing that sank Gore three years ago was his unfailing tendency to over-explain his positions, which I guess amounts to an overconfidence in the public's ability to see substance for anything but a lack of style. Clark has made his first major blunder by overexplaining his past political views in terms of his role as a military man: he still voted (often for Republicans), even if generals are (as he rightly suggests) supposed to be apolitical.\n\nSo he should account for himself, and the answer he could and _should_ be giving is simple: _because. I. Oppose. Bush. Dammit._ Such a position threatens his standing with Democratic activists -- people who have nothing better to do and somehow think a \$12 minimum wage could actually happen in this country -- but could strike a chord among swing voters in both parties. He wants to come across as the man whose frustration with the direction of this nation has _compelled_ him to seek its leadership, but the media is in the process of undressing him verbally, stripping him right down to his stated positions (which are scanty) and his past beliefs, which he's having trouble justifying.\n\nAs if that weren't enough of a problem for my candidate, his campaign organization seems to embody all the worst excesses of a political operation that has gotten too big, has too many chiefs who don't care about their Indians and doesn't yet have a clear message. Clark's campaign manager quit this week in a spat over a growing turf war between the internet draft types who started the whole thing and the professional operators brought in by the Clintons.\n\nThe funny thing: the turf war didn't go anywhere, just the man who was in the best position to stop it. So Clark 2004 is currently an organization comprised of people who fall into two schools of thought:\n\n1. *The internet will change the world. I can feel it in my aura!* Where do these people come from? Nader 2000. We all know how that turned out.\n\n2. *Hey! I know Bill Clinton so show some fucking respect!* These guys come mostly from Gore 2000. We all know how that turned out.\n\nThe biggest mistake Clark could make right now would be to trust that his staffers know better than he does how to present him to the public as a leader. He cannot afford to let his campaign office to become just another hot party for the polit kids, but that seems to be exactly what's happening. Take a look at this posting from the official Clark blog:\n\nbq. Lots of pizza, lots of soda, and yeah, lots of clapping.  I mean, sure, I'm biased, but... is this guy a star or what?  Personally, I'm looking forward to the one-on-one debate with President Bush. Mano a mano.  Anyway, back to the HQ (still full with about 50 of us at 10:30 pm, by the way).  Let the record show that the pizza in Little Rock is actually pretty good (even for this half-Italian pizza snob from NY)....\n\nGranted, they aren't even trying to present this as anything but cheerleading. The line that strikes me is the one about Clark getting to go one-on-one against Bush. I agree, that'll be pretty cool, but I'm having trouble reconciling that image with the one I got last night. You know, where they sat Clark off to the side, in between Al Sharpton and Carol Moseley-Braun, and Judy Woodruff had apparently been programmed to call on Dean or Kerry for just about every question.\n\nWhat Clark said is choice stuff. But if he can't get his ducks in a row, and find a way to stop letting the media treat him as an amusing sideshow...well, come on, people, do you really think Howard Dean is going to be the next President?\n\nReally? You are _so_ fucking naive."

And come straight back, boy.\n\nfn2. We're also the only major industrialized nation with no government support for the arts (since the NEA was castrated ten years ago), and whose support for higher education is limited to subsidizing the work of corporate loan sharks. Come to think of it, that's kind of how all basic human services work in this country: government-supported, government-sanctioned loan sharks. And we have the balls to call Russia a kleptocracy.\n\nfn3. Remind me to call Mariah Carey to ask how she spent her cut of that \$2,500."

Ethics policy\n\nAfter some discussions with one of the subjects of a February posting, I have decided to begin developing an \"Ethics Policy\":/about/ethics/ which will protect whatever individuals or groups I choose to write about on Practicalmadness.com while protecting my freedom to write about them and improving the quality of content to be found here.\n\nI have also removed the two weblog postings in question, and I am also looking into having them excised from Google's cache. I am considering the option of re-releasing them in a substantially rewritten form, that would preserve my original, legitimate intent in writing them while excising statements that I know I can't defend and don't care to. (Also, changing names to protect the innocent.)\n\nI stand by at least half of what I wrote, and after ten years in art school I've lost much of my former patience with all the usual excesses. Another option is to write an Article that addresses these excesses and my legitimate gripes without breaking the veil of confidentiality surrounding a college class.\n\nOr I could just leave stuff deleted and go on with my life. In any event, we apologize if any harm has been done, and hope that this new policy will prevent such issues in the future.\n\nh2. Dreamweaving redux\n\nNearly every version of Practical's page design has been done in \"Macromedia Dreamweaver\":http://www.macromedia.com/dreamweaver/, although the shitty performance and spotty CSS support in Dreamweaver MX forced me to do the most recent versions of the site using just BBEdit.\n\nThis morning Macromedia released a major new version, Dreamweaver MX 2004, with improved performance and robust CSS support. I have some complaints, but generally the new version is quite usable and I've used it a bit already to make some minor tweaks to the site. You can expect a full review later this week.\n\nh2. Is you is or is you ain't a weblog?\n\nIn the next couple of weeks I plan to (finally) start work on resurrecting the original structure of this site, with stuff organized by content rather than format. The same sort of technical and architectural issues that have plagued me all along haven't gotten any closer to resolved, but this month I've decided that I like the long-post format of the original Practical and will even in this space begin to move back to it.\n\nThe latest redesign has created a really, really good technical foundation, which I will build on to return this site to its former glory as the web's premier destination for insane content. Watch this space for more exciting developments.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go watch some paint dry."

    title: "Musing from a darkened Starbucks"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which the store goes dark."
    body: "p{text-align: center}. <img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/weblog/images/darkened_sbux.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" align=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"A Starbucks during a power outage, August 2003.\" />\n\nYou hear rumors of such things happening, but you never actually see it happen. You see, there is a policy that says a Starbucks can only close due to a power outage if said blackout continues for two hours, no less. And so, when we pray for an outage to last that long, it's not just because we hate our jobs and wish to go home.[1]\n\np{text-align: center}. <img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/weblog/images/darkened_sbux_2.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" align=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"View from inside a Starbucks during a power outage, August 2003.\" />\n\nIt's really kind of exciting, especially down here where we're so used to power outages. The odds are really against us being able to leave early -- most of the time, when the power goes out, it's back within fifteen minutes. So to hope for a lengthy outage is to wish for the extremely unlikely, and the anticipation goes up with each passing minute. _Will it happen or not?_\n\nWell, I'm in it for the excitement. My co-workers may very well have just wanted to go home, plain and simple. But _I'm_ telling this story, and I say it's about the fucking adrenaline rush. 'Kay?\n\nThe first fifteen minutes is the proverbial Big Break. Without power, there are no cash registers, coffee brewers, espresso shots or blended beverages. So we relax. On our manager's orders, we secured the exits and told any customers who wanted to leave to do so at that time. Then we made for the armchairs. Me, I played \"video games\":http://www.gamehouse.com/.\n\nAfter that, it's all about the growing likelihood that It's Actually Going To Happen, so we look for things to do that will help us leave quickly, before the power can come back on, once that two hour timer goes off. Before the emergency lamps went off, one person cleaned the bathrooms. I washed dishes in near-total darkness, then fuddled with the circuit breakers.\n\nLike I say, you hear about these things happening, but in two years with the company I've never seen it. I've seen some stores shut down because one of the biggest demonstrations in Chicago history is happening less than two blocks away, and the mass closing of all 2,500+ stores less than three hours after the 9/11 attacks. And I'm sure this month's mega-blackout down East shut down a boatload of 'em.\n\nBut just an everyday power outage? Fuhgeddaboutit."
    extended: "fn1. Actually, none of us is particularly disgruntled with Starbucks, apart from the usual piddling gripes everyone has with their employer. I can't speak for my two fellow team members this evening, but had we closed at the usual time, I would have had about seven hours total before I had to come right back to work in the morning.\n\nSo not only did we get to have our own little crisis situation to get a nice, non-coffee-related adrenaline rush, I get a whole extra hour or two of sleep. Sweet."

    title: "Baby, let's rock!"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "In which I briefly trash Zwan, explain certain incompatibilities between this site and Internet Explorer for Windows, and some other stuff. \"In which some other stuff?\", you ask? Shut up."
    body: "The preceding title has no particular meaning. Except perhaps this: is it just me, or does Zwan really, really, _really_ suck?\n\n<img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/weblog/images/practical_total_fitness.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The tenth circle of Hell. And wait till you see the contract.\" style=\"margin:0px 0px 10px 10px\" />I'm sure you know about _those people_. You know, _those people_ who you see gathering around the front door to Bally's at 5 AM, or popping into Starbucks somewhere closer to eight or nine still wearing jogging shorts and a fashionably shabby white T-shirt with a health club access card on their key ring. Or even that co-worker, classmate, friend, etc., who's always \"on [their] way to the gym.\"\n\nI am now one of those people. As part of our organization's Restructuring of Life Plan, I now have my health club membership that, at least for today, I am pointedly _not_ using.\n\nYesterday marked the signing of the contract and the grand tour of the facility, in that order. This particular local chain (which will remain nameless for the protection of the innocent) has several clubs in the area, all of which are better equipped than this one, which happens to be less than a mile from my house.\n\nThe layout is really interesting in the sense that it's a logical layout, and yet one that seems to enforce a certain health-club caste system. On one side of the ground floor, there's the LifeCycles(tm), treadmills and simple cardio equipment, operated by female professionals and older men whose doctors have told them they really mean it this time. On the other, there's the actual weightlifting stuff in a room filled with big, buff guys who probably have a football or basketball fantasy on a picture-in-picture in their minds even when having sex.\n\nOn the right, you have reasonable expectations and the tools to help achieve those expectations. On the left, you have a Soloflex commercial. Guess where I'll be handing in my pound of flesh.\n\nConsidering that I have no intention of honoring my one-year membership commitment[1], I feel like I'm coming out of this with a huge bargain. I have their lowest possible monthly rate, and yet with no restrictions on when I can use the club, and they even threw in two months of the latest innovation in personal fitness: personal trainer by proxy. I get two free sessions with an actual trainer, after which they program me into a computer which then prints out a daily workout routine for me based on my physical capabilities, fitness goals and whether the check cleared or not.\n\nIt's an entire program based around the concept that most gymgoers have no idea what they're doing (besides spending \$50/month and upwards on a major status symbol, that keychain card) and will spend an additional fortune each month to glean some actual benefit from their workouts, or at least feel like they are.\n\nIt's brilliant. I mean, it's one thing to capitalize on your customers' stupidity by drawing them into expensive long-term contracts. But to get them to pay _even more money_ by acknowledging that they have no idea what they're doing and offering to help? Bally should rip off and patent this. Hell, forget Bally -- someone call Microsoft.\n\nh2. A sideshow of a sideshow\n\nMeanwhile, speaking of Microsoft, you may be noticing that this blog's design has changed yet again. And if you're among the estimated 95%+ of us who use Internet Explorer for Windows, you may wonder what kind of cracked-out sadist I am to have made the navigation on the left side of the pages so, well, cracked out.\n\np{text-align: center; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding: 0px;}. <img src=\"http://www.practicalmadness.com/weblog/images/8-27-03_screenshot_comparis.jpg\" height=\"263\" width=\"500\" align=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Comparison of this site as displayed in IE 6 and a real browser (Safari).\" />\n\nAllow me, if you will, to explain. This latest design (that incorporates elements of the last five or six variations, and that I'm actually rather happy about) is built using only structural HTML and ample Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) stylings. This was not motivated by ideology (e.g., \"Structural markup is evil cant and must be purged from all thought!\") or trendiness as much as by the fact that I am very stupid, and growing moreso (also blind, lazy and impatient) with each passing day, and I'd truly much rather write one or two lines of code instead of ten whenever feasible.\n\nThis is where Windows IE users will have some problems, because IE/Win has incomplete support for the CSS2 selectors I'm using to present the new left-hand menu as an indented list of links, rather than the mishmashed disaster you may be seeing. There is a workaround; I just haven't gotten around to doing it yet.\n\nThere is, of course, another problem: the big, painted-esque stripe that covers the topmost 100 pixels of the pages is a transparent, 24-bit PNG. Internet Explorer is jus' fine with dem PNG files, but it don't cotton to no alpha-channel transparency, instead just turning everything blue.\n\nThis is an even easier fix: since PNG-24s are fuckin' huge anyway, I'll just replace it with a JPEG at some near juncture. Nice and conservative -- kinda like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/21/national/21JUDG.html\" target=\"_blank\">Roy's Rock</a> without the Roy, the rock or the insane mockery of the American judicial system.\n\nMac and Linux users will likely see things exactly as I have intended, as Internet Explorer for Mac and all the major alternative browsers have full CSS2 support. If you're such a huge Practical fan that you simply must see the new design in all its glory _right fucking now_, may I recommend \"Mozilla\":http://www.mozilla.org/ or any of its sister browsers?\n\nBut the more pleasant upshot of all this is that I've finally chosen a font to stick with: Helvetica. Until next week, when I'll go totally insane [again] and switch to Comicraft-Spills. Or maybe Webdings.\n\nOr --ooh! -- Comic Sans!\n\nh3. Addenda\n\nStarting right...about..._now_(!) the Extended Entry portion of any given post is now reserved exclusively for footnotes, for all that D.F. Wallace goodness.[2]"
    extended: "fn1. There is a clause in the contract which allows me to cancel without penalty upon my death, permanent disability or if I were to move more than fifteen miles away from any of their clubs. These circumstances are listed on the contract in that order.\n\nfn2. \"Don't you mean D.H. Lawrence?\"\nSadly, no. \n\"Oh! You mean the guy from _Braveheart_!\"\nNope.\n\"Oh. Who's D.F. Wallace, then?\"\nYou're soaking in him."

    title: "Dreamweaver MX 2004"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "CSS is the future (and present) of web formatting, and the upcoming new version of Macromedia's flagship web app seems to finally get it."
    body: "Macromedia has just released their new Studio MX 2004 product line, adding tons of new features and most importantly (to me, anyway), making <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/\" target=\"_blank\">Dreamweaver</a> the web design app it really ought to have been last year.\n\nI have been a Dreamweaver user (and avid fan) since the very beginning, but I rarely even use Dreamweaver MX (DMX) on my Mac for a few reasons:\n\n# It's slow.\n# Its CSS support is stuck in the dark ages. That is to say, 1998.\n# It's really, really slow.\n# The MX standard interface, while a huge improvement over previous versions, is still a little tweaky.\n\nAs all the various web technologies supported in Dreamweaver continue evolve, the onetime king of web development seems further and further out of date. The specs for the new version, Dreamweaver MX 2004 (MX '04), appears to address at least some of my major issues.\n\nThe biggest new feature being touted by Macromedia is improved CSS support. In DMX, the rendering is usable but quirky, especially when working with padding and margins. The user interface (virtually unchanged since Dreamweaver 3) for adding and editing CSS styles tries to use a word processor-like menu system to set options that correspond to lines of code, and the result is too arcane for ease of use, and too wimpy to be of any use.\n\nIn my own work I use DMX's CSS editor only for quick updates to stylesheets I've already written, or just update the code directly. Or, when I was designing on my Windows computer, I could just use TopStyle, a fine little application which allows for robust CSS editing by letting you select style attributes from a list, then type in the rule you want to apply. The idea with something like this is to help people who already know how to code do so more efficiently, rather than try to shield non-coders from the fearful unknown.\n\nTo bring this back around to MX '04, it would seem that in redesigning Dreamweaver's CSS features they were inspired by TopStyle. In <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/productinfo/features/static_tour/css/#item-4\" target=\"_blank\">screenshots</a> appearing on Macromedia's site, the new CSS palettes show a list of individual rules, not just class or tag definitions, which would allow for much more precise editing than the current GUI.\n\nWhy is CSS so important? Because the World Wide Web consortium is advocating the use of HTML completely without presentational markup, which includes FONT tags and even tables.\n\nUnder XHTML Strict, there are only structural tags denoting paragraphs, divisions, headers and so on, and CSS is required to make these small, tightly structured pages look fabulous. Improving CSS support is important not only as a convenience to Dreamweaver users -- it's a necessity to keep Dreamweaver from becoming obsolete.\n\nThe CSS editor is reason enough to upgrade, but Macromedia has even changed the way the Body Properties menu and text property inspector affect formatting to use CSS, rather than deprecated HTML tags and attributes. The upshot is pages that are better-looking, more compliant and easier to build.\n\nAnd as if all that weren't enough, Macromedia has added a built-in graphics editor (based on Fireworks) so that simple changes to an image file (especially cropping and resizing) can be done without opening up Photoshop. This doesn't mean we should all start using our P-shop discs as frisbees, but it's sure to be a timesaver.\n\nMacromedia has even addressed one of the longest-nagging complaints about Dreamweaver: you are no longer required, or even expected, to use Dreamweaver's site management features unless you want to. If you prefer to use another FTP application, or just don't want the hassle, you can open Dreamweaver to edit one file and even start working with dynamic data and server-side magic.\n\nThis is not to say that this was impossible before, but rather that seeing dialogs telling you a file was outside of your current site was probably very intimidating to newbies, and definitely very annoying to the rest of us.\n\nPerhaps best of all, \"Dreamweaver has been re-architected to improve performance in key areas such as opening and saving files, switching context, and switching in and out of the application.\"\n\nThis is marketing-speak for:\n\nbq. We screwed up, shipping a bloated, buggy piece of donkey crap that was a waste of your valuable time and money, and an insult to even the Carbon API's sense of common decency. We apologize, and would like to offer you the opportunity to spend full price all over again to get a version that actually works.\n\nh2. Things I still don't like\n\nThis is not to say that Macromedia still didn't leave a few annoying loose ends in rebuilding Dreamweaver. I have a running list of omissions and quirks that we can only hope will finally be addressed in the _next_ major version of the software.\n\nLongtime users are well aware of the \"code soup\" created when you use Dreamweaver's built-in JavaScript functions instead of writing your own.\n\nh2. Product activation\n\nThis review is based on a free trial version of the software, which longtime Macromedia watchers will know is just a sharewared copy of the real thing. I have every intention to buy it after the trial ends, but this means that I have yet to experience one of the other new additions to the Dreamweaver experience: product activation.\n\nProduct activation is the antipiracy technique first used to any large degree by Microsoft on their XP releases of Windows and Office. It involves taking a snapshot of your computer's hardware configuration and submitting that to a central computer at the software manufacturer, which then uses that information and your product serial number to generate a unique key that is needed to activate your product. This way they can ensure that only one computer is using any one serial number, which protects them from piracy.\n\nMost people will never notice any change from the old ways: if your computer is connected to the internet, this process is invisible and seamless. But if you're not connected to the internet, you'll have to call the company for your activation key. And if you make too many changes to your system's hardware setup, you may have to call them up for a new key.\n\nHaving gotten away with <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/activation/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">adding an activation feature</a> to the just-released Contribute 2, Macromedia has deemed this new initiative a raging success and will be requiring activation on all Studio MX '04 products.\n\nBut Macromedia's approach to activation is much more liberal than Microsoft or Quark's, explicitly allowing software to be installed on more than one computer (although only one installation is to be used at a time) and (reportedly) allowing more changes to your computer's hardware configuration without prompting you to re-activate."

Of course, any Trixies who are Creationists, Objectivists or Scientologists would reside in the worst circle of Hell that applied to their circumstances. A T. who is a Creationist and _does not_ drink Starbucks or Wear The Plaid can go to the fourth circle of Hell, whereas a T. who is a Scientologist goes straight to the center.\n* I would have expanded the first circle, for Rednecks, to include all ignorant persons. That is, ignorant in my view, which is much more evil and limiting than in the broader world view. E.g., Paula Zahn's TV persona gets to go to Hell for this reason, although I think we can nail her for Trixieism regardless.\n* This says nothing about where to place those who have committed a Seven Deadly Sin. I would put gluttons with the militant vegans, greedsters with the Objectivists and so on.\n* A special room in the ninth circle of Hell will be reserved for anyone whose child has gotten into trouble who responded by suing the school, the town, a major video game publisher, MTV, et al.\n\nI think this is a workable model for a Hell, and I await your comments.\n\nWait, what's this? _I turned off the comments!!! BWAH-HAHAHAHAHAAA!!!_"

    body: "Someone has developed an amazing little web tool which can analyze the syntactic quirks of one's writing and issue a verdict:<a href=\"http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.html\" target=\"_blank\"> is the author male or female?</a> So I tested the last five or six entries to this weblog, and was unnerved to find that my writing style comes out female every time.\n\nI haven't studied the algorithm (read: looked very closely at my scores), but as near as I can figure it has something to do with the number of pronouns I use.\n\nFor example, let's study this excerpt from Kottke.org, which the Gender Genie identified as male:\n\nbq. I pass a woman saying to another woman that Madison Square Garden is on fire. Two minutes later, I walk past a very intact and very much not burning Madison Square Garden. The crowd is so dense that we're all shuffling along, no one getting anywhere fast. Someone bumps into the person in front of me. \"Hey, watch where the hell you're going.\" People are little scared and seem on edge. I don't hear the word terrorism, but the air is thick with the thought.\n\nCompare this to a typical excerpt from this site:\n\nbq. You would send a message to your old pal but you don&#8217;t know what to say, as you suspect he wrote you off years ago. Really, bucko, do you think these people are going to come to you as friends when you go back? Do you think anyone will? Are you going to walk into the one Chicago bar that is free of pretense, and fearlessly strike up a conversation with the one Chicago girl who is free of pretense, not to mention beautiful and brilliant?\n\nWhat makes Kottke a manly man in the eyes of this algorithm, and me so very not?\n\nThe Kottke excerpt describes external events (albeit in the context of a personal experience). The Practical excerpt is an interior monologue, not to mention more conversational. So is this algorithm saying, in essence, that journalistic writing is more male, and diaristic writing is more female? Description = phallus, self-involvement = not so much?\n\nHaving finally gotten the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/magazine/10wwln-test.html?ex=1061524800&#38;en=99543204fe175f21&#38;ei=5070\" target=\"_blank\">NY Times article explaining the methodology</a> to work, I can tell you. The hallmarks of female writing, at least for purposes of this experiment, are possessives, especially possessive pronouns like 'your', as well as negative words ('not' or any word ending with 'n't'). So the sentence\n\nbq. For your manhood could not fill me with desire.\n\nis uber-female. Whereas the hallmarks of male writing are indefinite articles ('a', 'the', 'some') and pronouns ('it'), as well as numbers. So if I try very, very hard, I come up with a sentence like this one:\n\nbq. The hall was filled by fifty old canasta players. It smelled like some person's old socks.\n\nand it tests male. Of course, that's probably not how I would write out the same thought in the normal course of things. It would probably look something like this:\n\nbq. So there were fifty old canasta players in the hall, and they all smelled like old socks. Not that I know from old socks, mind you...\n\nWhich, of course, tests as female.\n\nSo what's the secret to manly writing? Or rather: The secret to manly writing is to keep things extremely simple. Do not comment on the action until absolutely necessary, and do not self-refer. The situation sucks! It really sucks! But commentary should be no more personal than that.\n\nI can be a character in the writing, but it is important to remember that in this manly universe, my viewpoint represents truth absolute. Thus it is not necessary to remind the reader so constantly of my presence, my feelings, my viewpoint. I am a Hemingway robot: laconic and dull, because that is the gender role a web site has forced upon me.\n\nAnd yet, how does the algorithm find this passage as a whole?\n\nBloody female again.\n\n*Note:* <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/magazine/10wwln-test.html?ex=1061524800&#38;en=99543204fe175f21&#38;ei=5070\" target=\"_blank\">The original _Times_ article</a> says that the algorithm is intended for works of fiction, and so may not be totally appropriate for webloggers. Of course, <a href=\"http://601am.com/archives/03/08/030819_you_write_like_a_girl.php\" target=\"_blank\">the site on which I found the link to the test</a> shows that generally, what's true for fiction writers is true for webloggers as well. I have no choice but to go to the mall and pick out a nice, frilly dress. But first, a beer."

    body: "Modern politics is less about visionary leadership than about team-building. Just look at the Bush cartel: does anyone really believe that this wannabe Texas cowboy who can barely string a sentence together if more than two people are watching him is the all-encompassing mastermind of his administration's various programs? Of course not, but it's equally wrong to dismiss him just because we think good old Dick Cheney has his fingers directly in more of the pies.\n\nThis is corporate-style leadership: while there is a figurehead and that individual is not without power, their administration lives or dies based on the people to whom they choose to delegate the important work.\n\nIt's all about team-building, which is why today's announcement that Arnold Schwarzenegger has recruited Warren Buffett as his key economic advisor demonstrates why the Terminator may have what it takes not only to win this seriously fucked-up election, but to actually do right by the populace.\n\nAll you need at the top, you see, is someone with a vision, willing to do whatever it takes to make it reality. Whatever Arnold's reasons for seeking office -- and they're almost certainly less selfish than most of the idiots running in the recall -- his history suggests that he knows a few things about achieving his goals, and that the world's savviest investor is willing to join his campaign indicates that they're the right goals.\n\nI am fully aware that to be impressed by Schwarzenegger's choice of advisors (and even moreso by Buffett's choice of candidates) doesn't make the man any less a Republican, or this recall any less silly. But let's take a closer look at this situation. What kind of Republican is Schwarzenegger, really? Is he the authoritarian, ultra-conservative type who goes to war over phantom Iraqi WMDs?\n\nHe has been an exemplary manager of his own life: driven, realistic and clearly, quietly effective. If even a subset of that informs Arnold's approach to government (even hypothetically, as a candidate) it makes him, frankly, a compelling possibility. What most separated Gore from Bush three years ago (at least in my opinion) was that Gore had the makings of an effective president, with solid (if unsexy) programs and a commitment to maintaining and even improving on the success of the Clinton years.\n\nWhat Bush had on Gore (and now has on every other prospective Presidential candidate) is _flash_. I think our President is a weaselly little rodent-monkey, and yet I will acknowledge that when he's fired up, and speaking coherently, and managing not to offend my semi-leftist sensibilities, that there is a spark in his eyes that just screams warrior spirit. He may not be a President, but he can play one on TV better than anyone else out there right now. He inspires far more confidence than he should.\n\n_Demolition Man_ notwithstanding, Arnold will never be a President, but he has the potential to inspire, and perhaps even the potential to govern.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily make him a good governor, but it certainly makes him _feel_ more like a governor than your average Austrian action hero."

    title: "Patrician"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "This will certainly make things awkward the next time I have to tell him to pay for his paper or get out."
    body: "He has a head like a Roman senator, as if 'PATRICIAN' were tattooed on his brow. You know that he comes from money -- his brother owns the firm that owns the city's most upscale shopping center -- and yet he will try to cheat you if he could.\n\nYour co-workers hate him, leading to an awkward confrontation over the matter of a stolen Wednesday newspaper. Not even the whole newspaper, actually, just the Sports section, just for the one article the Patrician wants to read. And yet, they know his drink, and start it as soon as he walks in the door, like all those regulars they _do_ like.\n\nWhich, as if on cue, will have the whole staff whispering about how he used to try to trick us into just charging him for a refill, when we all know good and well that he just walked in, and you can't get refills on that drink anyway! And did you know that he's a millionaire? He's independently wealthy, but he's been kicked out of every Starbucks in town. Except this one.\n\nAnd so, the Patrician keeps coming in every day. You, you make no judgements, for in your experience regulars are just ordinary customers at best and an unfortunate but steady revenue stream at worst. You handle them the same way you would any customer: with a smile, patience and quiet professionalism. You afford this regular the same courtesy you would anyone else -- when he walks in the door, if your hands are free, you start his drink, because that's just considerate. It's simply the least you can do.\n\nIt is clear to the Patrician that you are nicer to him than the others; it is clear to just about everyone who walks in that door that you are nicer than the others, and it's clear to you that the others don't give one flying bean. So when he strikes up a conversation, he asks what's up with the others. He suspects that you might just be the one barista who appreciates his business, which in turn just might validate his existence.\n\nBecause he loves Starbucks, you see. This man, who has been banned from all but this one of the five local stores, still loves Starbucks coffee, and needs his daily infusion to survive. So perhaps he sees in you someone in which he can confide his frustration at being treated like a criminal, just because he doesn't want to pay 35 cents to read one lousy article in a newspaper he was going to put back anyway.\n\nThen, as you tell him about your background -- he doesn't know you, of course, as you are only a recent arrival at this particular coffee shop -- you are surprised to learn that this Patrician, as wealthy as you are poor who seemingly knows everyone, have a friend in common. It's nothing good or bad; you just move in very different social circles.\n\nAnd for this you feel a bit like The Talented Mr. Demaree, and something you have long suspected is confirmed, kind of: that certain friends really had no excuse not to be geniuses, for their energies really didn't have anywhere else to go. It's nothing good or bad, really, although it does explain why the necessary long focus on the practical seems to have taken all the spark out of your madness. Your friend, by whose father you are sort of connected to this wacky old Patrician, had no such compunction.\n\nThe Patrician gives you certain details of the friend's current situation, and for a moment -- this is where the Ripley factor comes in -- you feel that here a connection has been made that outstrips the natural limit of your involvement with this friend, his father, the Patrician: you have strayed out of your class here, sir. And while we are currently giving you the benefit of the doubt, soon we will learn that this son of a friend of a Patrician doesn't even have you on his Friendster network. Knowing this, we will put you in your place.\n\nConsidering this makes you glad that you left your last encounter with the Friend on more or less good terms, as regardless of any connections you may wish to explore in the future with this friend, his father or this Patrician, the simple fact remains: you will see this man with the head like a Roman senator every single day, you are the only one who is nice to him, and now he feels like he _knows_ you.\n\nThis will certainly make things awkward the next time I have to tell him to pay for his paper or get out."

You have come a long way, eighteen months since you last felt comfortable with your website, to discover what you already knew: that 12-pixel Verdana really is the best body text for your purposes.\n\n2. And white text on black hurts one's eyes so much less than the alternative.\n\n3. And black text on a cream-colored background? Might as well be gray on gray, or in Sanskrit.\n\n4. Your site is slighter than you ever suspected since you stopped covering politics, movies, society, or any of the dozens of topics Practical had pages on before the weblog thing.\n\n5. Weeks later, you still like the spaghetti boy, even if you now realize that you ripped off the faded stripes motif from <a href=\"http://www.hivelogic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hivelogic</a>.\n\n6. Okay, you can have the rough-edged background. Or the green stripes. But not both.\n\n7. Those old movie reviews really blew. Sadly, the current movies blow, even if your reviewing style has made a quantum leap. So your options are to find a thousand non-cliched, non-dismissive words about _The Hulk_ or to figure out how to pose as a rock critic.\n\n8. While a lovely idea, you now realize that Textile is not appropriate for every situation.\n\n9. You really should have checked out _Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots_ much sooner.\n\n10. You congratulate Family Cat B on the birth of her kittens, while scolding Family Cat A for deflowering Family Cat B."

You have to admit that as a quote, it seems much more reasonable than the following:\n\n<blockquote>Pride is closely related to hubris, which is closely related to arrogance, which is closely related to downfall.</blockquote>\n\nAs to who said it, I don't recall with any reliability, but it is safe to assume that they maintain a journal of some kind, and if they were alive today it would be a blog.\n\nThis is the part of the movie where I segue wildly into a list of really annoying memes which have infected Practicalmadness.com over the past week, then vanished as if nothing happened:\n\n* References to Lemony Snicket's _Series of Unfortunate Events_, e.g., \"repetitive, a word which here means 'really, really annoying.'\"\n* The practice of referring to myself, Your Author and Better, as \"the Management,\" and writing weblog posts, homepage text and about pages in the first person plural. We are over it.\n* Footnotes.[1]\n* The use of really, really bizarre metaphors to make my points, to obfuscate the fact that I don't really have any. Imagine a room full of flesh-eating piranha, with a Swedish Chef finger puppet dangling from a gossamer-thin strand of spaghetti suspended from the ceiling. Were the floor made of water, you may have trouble reaching the puppet, but either way, my case for \"Parsing David's Increasingly Psychotic Prose\" as an Olympic event gets better all the time.\n* Bulleted lists.\n** Next week, I may yet switch back to angle quotes.\n*** Ooh, or numbers!\n* Remaining blind to the fact that having the Wee Spaghetti Lad on every single page makes it difficult for those of us with really lazy eyes and short attention spans to tell one page from another. Our engineers are working on the problem, and we are prepared to offer the Spaghetti Boy no less than five(5) cans of Chef Boyardee if he will consider moving over to the right-hand column, or at least shrinking slightly, on most pages deeper than da hizzome.\n* Referring to the home page as 'da hizzome'. This has been used exactly twice, and we will not speak of this again.\n\nNext week: posts in Latin. \"Salve, Porcellus!\""

    body: "This week's issue of <em>Time</em>, just arrived in this body's mailbox, features a cover story about how <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030804/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">meditation's not just for the pitiably muggable anymore</a>. The cover features a woman engaged in meditation; the caption identifies her as...hmm, this is interesting. It would seem that Time Magazine has accomplished the seemingly unprecedented: making Heather Graham look ordinary.[1]\n\nThe story itself is worth a look see. The reporter is Joel Stein, who is not to be confused with Joe Klein, who anonymously published <em>Primary Colors</em>. No, this Stein is the one who recently filed a story about how he convinced the Trio cable network to let him air really bad programming for a week. His meditation piece opens on a similar note.\n\n<blockquote>The one thought I cannot purge, the one that keeps coming back and getting between me and my bliss, is this: What a waste of time. I am sitting cross-legged on a purple cushion with my eyes closed in a yoga studio with 40 people, most of them attractive women in workout outfits, and it is accomplishment enough that I am not thinking about them.</blockquote>\n\nI should point out -- because isn't it my job as a weblog writer to somehow apply any damned thing to my own experience? -- that the yoga-doing performance-art coeds at my school are often, yes, hotties on a basic, physical level. But that is not the point of this piece! We must also consider the thematic and, uh, political significance!\n\nThis is to say that they're often insufferable leftist harpies who didn't get the memo about evocative nudity going out with disco. To wit, the girl who once videotaped her naked body with \"Smack My Bitch Up\" on the soundtrack. This is not the end of the story; she apparently asked her director of photography on the piece (her boyfriend) to take special care to avoid certain private, sensitive areas of her gentialia.\n\nSo the camera swerves to avoid the lower bathing-suit area, and yet it is presented to us as a 'raw, immediate statement of my sexuality and womanhood'[2]. In true art-school style, the class bought it until someone (oh, all right: me) found the gonads to say something critical. And what was that scathing remark?\n\n\"Umm...well, I can see that this is a nude. But how is this <em>your</em> nude?\"\n\nIn the above statement, feel free to insert just about any noun in place of the word <em>nude</em>, and use liberally in any setting. To test it, try using the word <em>dildo</em>."
    extended: "fn1. <em>Ordinary</em> is a word which here means \"less than <a href=\"http://www.ecrannoir.fr/stars/us/images/hg/graham2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">all-encompassingly shagadelic</a>.\"\n\nfn2. This is a <em>paraphrase</em>, a word which here means \"nothing like what she said, and in fact something I just made up because it's funny art-school gibberish.\""

    body: "The management expects that we lack the requisite attention span for what we are proposing, but the idea has popped into my mind for a series of articles about _Why Great Movies Matter_.\n\nFormatically (yay, I coined a word!) it would be not unlike Harold Bloom's _How To Read and Why_, a wonderful book I promise I'll get around to finishing one of these days, in the sense that I will choose from my personal canon one of these so-called \"great movies\", and explain why it is relevant to us now, however many years after its release.\n\nSome choices are obvious, in the sense that I'm not sure if I could say anything about them that wouldn't have popped right into the head of any brain-damaged chimp with a love for classic film. Into this category I would plop _Network_, which I've watched twice since I got it on DVD yesterday, and which is so goddamned timely that I really have trouble remembering that it was made almost thirty years ago.\n\nThen there are the movies that people _think_ they know, but they don't really. Last summer I happened to find myself ranting to a professor about _Lawrence of Arabia_, and apparently I was quite persuasive and the conversation ended with this avant-garde video artist actually seeing some merit in what he had previously written off as bourgeois narrative drivel.\n\nThis would and would not be like \"Roger Ebert's\":http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ ongoing series of \"Great Movies\" reviews -- they are personal recollections (which is like), but not necessarily based around placing the films into any sort of canon or explaining/justifying their greatness (unlike).\n\nThey may be Towering Masterpieces of Cinema, these things you call (in hushed tones) _Citizen Kane_ and _Wings of Desire_, but they are personally relevant to me and I want to tell you about them.\n\nAdditionally, all the movies currently in release _suck_. Yes, children, I am including the indie and art-house movies in this. When Cannes goes as badly as it did this year, I take this as a sign that _The Matrix Revolutions_ and _The Return of the King_ are probably the best I can expect from this year at the cinema, and so I hope you will forgive my less-than-eagerness to waste a few hundred words on _The Hulk_.\n\nScratch that: I may yet waste some words on _The Hulk_, and as soon as I've got the magnificent _Morvern Callar_ programmed, categorized and easily referenced, I'll let you know. But I don't have any new movie reviews planned, per se. This _Why Great Movies Matter_ scheme allows me to resurrect certain elements of practical cine-madness without feeling compelled to make the producers of _Terminator 3_ any damned richer.\n\nAnd I will. I may yet, if I don't lose my nerve."

    body: "CNET News.com is reporting that a <a href=\"http://rss.com.com/2100-1012_3-1026181.html?type=pt&#38;part=rss&#38;tag=feed&#38;subj=news\" target=\"_blank\">new version of Macromedia Contribute</a> coming out tomorrow will add Mac support and, oh, year, their first-ever attempt at product activation.\n\nProduct activation is the controversial antipiracy measure used on Windows XP, where the software takes a snapshot of your PC's configuration and sends that in to a central server, which generates a unique activation code that will work on one -- and only one -- computer. \n\nIdeally this is a totally transparent process and presents no hassles to the customer. But another problem arises when you change your PC's configuration: adding or removing components may invalidate the activation key, leaving you with an operating system refusing to operate until you call Microsoft to re-register.\n\nMacromedia's use of this sort of technology is funny, because their applications have always been the easiest in the world to pirate. Full versions of Macromedia apps are available for download on a trial basis, and ship with software that is supposed to render them inoperable after 30 days. But this software has always been easy to beat -- I got my first few versions of Dreamweaver and Flash that way.\n\nOf course, now I've gone straight: I own my current copy of Dreamweaver MX, and I don't use Flash at all. I just find it ironic that a company whose antipiracy measures have always been an open door is choosing to try more extreme measures, only to water them down so as not to scare off any customers."

    title: "The last death of Netscape"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "<em>In which</em> I eulogize the browser that got us all here to begin with."
    body: "It would seem that rumors of Netscape's ultimate demise are, in fact, finally true.\n\nAt the risk of taking too much credit, I had considered blogrolling this morning's news that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-foundation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla is being spun off into an independent foundation</a> with some snarky comment about being kicked out of AOL's house, but decided against it. I thought, 'you know, it's possible to just read too much into something.' And yet here we are.\n\nWhat is happening: AOL is firing (or reassigning, but mostly firing) most, if not all, of the full-time staffers who were working on and managing the Mozilla project(s). Development of the Netscape browser (which is just a repackaging of Mozilla 1.x) will go into \"maintenance mode\", which I think is a polite way of saying that they will issue a bug fix if Netscape suddenly starts turning computers into toasters, but nothing more.\n\nMy personal feeling is that this move was a long time coming, and while it's foolish to say that the recent detente between AOL and Microsoft had no impact on the death of Netscape, it's equally foolish to think that Netscape was anything but irrelevant in the last few years.\n\nWhich is a shame, because Netscape had a lot of talented people, such that it still bewilders me how they could let Communicator 4.x out into the world as if it were a usable product. I remember how I felt when IE 4 came out -- it was amazing to have a browser that didn't take five minutes to load (not really, but it sure felt like it) and was (if you believe it) more standards-compliant than Netscape.\n\nThat isn't to say that Netscape Navigator -- the original -- wasn't a revelation. I came to Netscape straight from that original, crappy AOL browser and it was like going from black and white to color television. The same could be said for the transition from IE6 to Mozilla 1.0, and my introduction to tabbed browsing.\n\nAnd yet Netscape 6 -- the first released browser to bear the Netscape name since the disaster that was version 4.0 -- was slow and buggy. It's like the Netscape brand name had become a curse: Mozilla was good, but when rebranded as Netscape it became unusable. The truth is much more complex than that, but that's how it felt.\n\nAOL's shutdown of Netscape doesn't feel like anything more or less than the signing of a Do Not Resuscitate form -- they're giving up a battle that was lost a very long time ago. It's not like the browser wars are completely over -- Mozilla and, more likely, Safari will be at the center of border skirmishes for years to come. But Netscape's death march is finally over."

This is a good thing, as the whole 'fifteen windows open at once and loving it' thing does not translate well to the Wintel world. And one other thing that FeedDemon gets right even as IE6 gets it dead wrong: tabbed browsing.\n\nThis app looks to be a good way to introduce Windows users to the joys of RSS, and this is only the first public beta. Generally, I like it."

    body: "Entire thick volumes (probably sold by O'Reilly for upwards of forty bucks, with a picture of some strange creature on the cover) could be devoted to the subject of hacking the CSS box model.\n\nTo briefly initiate the uninitiated, the box model is an arcane sort of name for the way boxes (i.e., almost any element on a web page) can be described using cascading style sheets (CSS), specifically how such rules as margins, padding, borders and so on are applied. There is a long, extremely detailed standard box model provided by the fine folks at the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, and many a web professional can sleep easier at night knowing that such a marvelous thing exists.\n\nSo why the hacking? Because, true to form, Microsoft thinks they know better than the standard, and the meticulously-crafted stylesheets a designer works up in accordance with the official standard often come out looking totally different in Internet Explorer for Windows than they do in more compliant, less popular browsers like Safari or even IE for Mac.\n\nThus we're right back where we were back in the heady days of Netscape 4: finding a way to make the same web page display the same on all browsers without resorting to violence. We've come a long way, O my brothers and sisters -- such a thing is at least possible now.\n\n<a href=\"http://tantek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tantek &#199;elik</a>, the web guru who (among other achievements) designed the rendering engine used in IE5/Mac, also developed the most oft-cited hack to make IE for Windows use one set of intentionally freaky style rules, while supplying a correct set for use by other browsers.\n\nTantek's box model hack consists of exploiting a bug in IE's rendering engine where it would skip to the next rule in the stylesheet if it came across a closing curly brace (\"}\"), even if such were located inside a comment. And many people found this to be sufficient until the release of Internet Explorer 6.\n\nWe want to be able to say that this story has a happy ending -- that IE6 for Windows is a standards-compliant browser and web code you write for one browser will now display flawlessly in all. Unfortunately, while IE6 fixed the bug that made the box model hack possible, it failed to fix the CSS rendering problems that made the hack necessary.\n\nBut not to fret: I have found a solution. More accurately, I am taking credit for an obvious solution which somehow fails to show up on the first page of Google's search results.\n\nIE6 still does not support the <em>!important</em> CSS rule, which allows designers to tell the browser that a particular rule must be obeyed and cannot be overridden. However, IE5/Mac, WebKit (i.e. Safari and latter-day OmniWeb betas) and Gecko (Mozilla, Camino and Netscape) <em>do</em> obey !important, so an IE6-compatible box model hack is as simple as eating pudding.\n\nJust do something like this:\n\n<blockquote>margin-top: -10px !important;<br/>\nmargin-top: 0px;</blockquote>\n\nWhat this does: The first rule tells the browser to lift whatever you're styling ten pixels further up the page than normal, and to obey this rule no matter what else you tell it. In my case, I'm asking it to correct for a little glitch where the first line of the left column of the new CSS-based Practical layout appears ten pixels lower than the start of the right column, which just isn't pretty.\n\nUnfortunately, IE6 doesn't need this -- its aligns my layout perfectly by default, and it protests my second-guessing by clipping the tops off of all the letters on that first line. This is where the second rule comes in. Since IE6 ignores !important, I give it a new rule to override the old one, returning the margin to its happily default state. \n\nMeanwhile, those browsers that support the !important rule know to disregard that second line, so everyone is happy. Especially me and my monkey."

    body: "FX is playing the 1997 movie <em>Volcano</em>, the thrilling story of a city under siege...oh, fuck it: it's a disaster movie about a volcano popping up in the middle of Los Angeles, and the chaos that ensues. It's total B-movie cheese, with Tommy Lee Jones and a cute, pre-coming out Anne Heche as The Only People Who Can Stop It.\n\nOur first sign that the script doctors had a field day with this one:\n\n<blockquote>(Two guards are moving paintings out of a museum that's about to be consumed by a lava flow.)<br/>\n1st. Guard: Man, this Hieronymus Bosch is heavy! <br/>\n2nd. Guard: That's because he deals with man's inclination towards sin, in defiance of God's will.<br/>\n1st. Guard: I didn't mean it like that.</blockquote>\n\nI saw this three or four times in theaters -- its only competition was <em>Star Wars: The Version In Which Han Shoots In Self-Defense</em> -- and I'd forgotten just how bad this movie was without seeming particularly inept. It's as if the filmmakers kept telling themselves, \"it's okay if the best dialogue we can come up with for this scene is 'Look, (Character Name), I know you're scared. But I need you to...' It's a freakin' volcano movie.\"\n\nMeanwhile, millions were spent on CGI shots of flowing lava that is so hot that it can destroy a subway train from ten feet away, but not hot enough to so much as singe a dog from seven <em>inches</em> away. Clearly the lava is meant to represent the inexorable destruction of logic and reason of which Los Angeles is the epicenter.\n\nHow else could a guy jump into it, still be alive and in one piece such as to throw the man he's carrying to safety (distance from lava: nine inches) and then slowly, steadily <em>sink</em> as little rings of fire burn up the legs of his jeans?\n\n'Jump, Stan! You can make it! Oops, uh, aw, damn, I guess you can't...umm...uh, dammit, Stan, we tol' you to get yo' ass on a fuckin' Stairmaster!'\n\nStan's reply: \"AAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!\"\n\nAs I recall, the first act (which has just culminated in the eruption of the La Brea Tar Pits, the uniting of heroes Jones and Heche against the Fiery Terror and the arrest of a token, non-star black guy by a caricature of a racist LAPD cop) leads to the second, in which the lava flow changes direction and the hero's daughter is Not Out Of Danger After All.\n\nThis leads to the grand finale, in which some stuff happens and the leads come together as One Big Happy Family. This is an agreeable alternative to the Male And Female Lead Get It On Ending, as Tommy Lee Jones's involvement renders that ending a little bit, well, gross.\n\nThere is a legend of Stanley Kubrick where the master goes to see every film playing in New York City and decides that there's no way that he couldn't do better. Watching <em>Volcano</em> makes me think that a brain-damaged four-year-old couldn't manage to come up with <em>something</em> more filmically correct than this."

    body: "The City Center, the new yuppie-oriented shopping center a few miles away in Vestavia Hills, has the obligatory asian joint and sandwich shop, but I was drawn to something I really, truly did not want to exist: Sneaky Pete's Cafe.\n\nBirmingham residents know all about Sneaky Pete's hot dog stands, serving franks of questionable lineage doused in a mysterious 'special sauce' for over two decades. In Chicago, this sort of place would be some kind of local legend. In Birmingham, they're just the sort of local dive we're desperately trying to reinvent ourselves away from.\n\nIt turns out that even Sneaky Pete's is down with the whole reinvention thing, hence this unholy cafe concept.\n\nHere's how a Sneaky Pete's Cafe works: there is a hostess, and table service. You are seated, your drink order is taken and you ponder a large selection of standard lunch fare. The \"steamed\" sandwiches don't really fill one with confidence, but the few entrees and salads sound appealing enough, and the burgers sound downright good. And, of course, there's the Sneaky Pete's hot dogs, listed with the same crimson embossed lettering as the finer foods on the other five pages of the menu.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with an eatery serving nicer food in a nicer setting in this really rather nice little shopping center. But this is Sneaky Pete's, serving the same greasy chili dogs with mustard as can be had in a greasy little stand in the mall, cafe fries be damned. And coming to Sneaky Pete's for a chili dog, fries and sweet tea should not be a production -- my food should come wrapped in paper and stuffed carelessly into a paper sack, for which I shall exchange a wad of crumpled bills, as if I'm a wino staggering in for my 2 AM fix.\n\nIt is this juxtaposition -- a genteel dining experience which yields only wieners -- that troubles me so, Dear Reader. Some of my fondest...well, pleasant...okay: there are memories from high school which involve Sneaky Pete's. They are not unpleasant, nor will I make a point to tell my grandchildren about them. When I tell the grand, sweeping narrative of how I met my true love and found Happiness Everlasting, I only hope Sneaky Pete's will not come into the story even as a tangent.\n\nAnd yet, I was <em>served</em> my chili dog the other day. It was brought to me on a non-disposable plate, with agreeable presentation and more subtly-seasoned fries than I remember, and when I was done, the check was brought to me in a leather folder. I stuck my credit card in the slot and left it on the table, per the same procedure I would use paying for an exquisite brunch at the Bongo Room.\n\nWe are talking about <em>chili dogs</em> here, people. Sneaky Pete's <em>chili dogs</em>, for christ's sake. And then, when everything was paid for, I found myself deciding between the microcreamery ice cream parlor and Starbucks for dessert. \n\nWhen I left town for my freshman year of college, Birmingham wasn't even a twinkle in Starbucks's eye. Now there are five stores, and a local market primed for microcreameries, organic markets and hot dog stands with table service and a wine list."

    body: "I've been seeing a lot of TV commercials for Juno, the K-Mart to AOL's Wal-Mart, advertising a service they're calling SpeedBand. The implication is that for \$14.95, you can have high-speed internet just like all us clowns who are paying \$30 or more every month for cable/DSL lines.\n\nThis all sounds very compelling. However, just as the commercial and the Juno SpeedBand logo fade to black, a quick-eyed viewer may happen to notice this little disclaimer:\n\n<blockquote>Does not increase transmission speed of files or attachments.</blockquote>\n\nHmm. That's interesting. So you say it's faster, and yet it does not download files or attachments any faster than regular dial-up? We must research this, and research this I have. To answer this question, I clicked on a link titled \"How does SpeedBand work?\"\n\nSpeedBand is dial-up internet, pure and simple. Juno is able to speed up web page downloads by using a \"proprietary technology\" which sounds suspiciously like a proxy server that downloads the page, zips it and sends it down the dialup line. On your end, a proprietary SpeedBand client unzips the page and makes it look pretty.\n\nOf course, if the SpeedBand client goes awry, you're back in the stone age. Sure, web pages load slightly faster, but in return you're back to busy signals, dropped connections and not being able to use your phone. Meanwhile, downloading a new version of your web browser, or any other software, will still take ages. And streaming video? Fuhgeddaboutit.\n\nThis would not bother me so much if Juno's happy, happy, <em>happy</em> commercials didn't try to present this service as being anything like real broadband. Having had a full-time, super-speedy internet connection at home for two or three years makes me wonder how anyone can still live with dialup.\n\nIn closing, let me address the designers of Juno's web site. I know you were trying to be helpful by detecting the platform I'm using and showing me only information tailored to the Mac OS X version of Juno. But when I click on a link that says \"What is Juno SpeedBand?\", \"Juno SpeedBand is currently only available for Windows computers\" is not an acceptable answer. That is not the question I asked."

More importantly, dear reader, what does <em>your</em> buddy icon say about <em>you?</em>\n\nI'm using iChat AV to connect to AIM. Most AIMsters (presumably using one of the myriad versions of the original AOL Instant Messenger) have their choice of any number of predesigned buddy icons supplied by Your Trusted Friends at AOL. I'm sure you can also supply your own image, but the easiest method is to just pick something from the menu. That this is usually something promoting an AOL Time Warner product -- a Cartoon Network character, a Warner Bros. movie, a Warner Music artist -- is just beautiful synergy.\n\niChat, on the other hand, will <em>only</em> let you use an icon you provide yourself, but it does this more easily than you can do just about anything on AOL Instant Messenger -- you just drag your photo (or other image) onto the buddy icon next to your name in the Buddy List window, and a dialog lets you crop and zoom the image to create the perfect 32x32 pixel avatar.\n\nThis can be liberating or limiting. I use a simple photo of myself -- I have no need to hide behind Ian McKellen As Gandalf -- but I don't have the pleasure(?) of figuring out which ugly AOL advertisement I want to represent me over IM.\n\nSo is Felix the Cat right to say that my buddy icon is 'arrogant'?"

What is that, you ask? The Dr. Pepper I bought the other day had a saccharine taste -- it practically reeked of artificial sweetener. So this is a cut-and-dried case where they accidentally swapped the regular and diet Dr. Pepper, or ran out of the former so just doubled up on the latter, right?\n\nPossibly, but not even bona fide Diet Dr. Pepper tastes <i>that</i> sacchariney. I know this; I checked.\n\nThis evening I have nursed a Coke instead of a Pepper. It is not the same."

    body: "I find myself craving the end title themes for two films scored by Howard Shore (now best known for his work on the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies): <i>Philadelphia</i>, which is sort of an intimate, kinda melancholy strings-and-horns deal, and <i>Looking for Richard</i>, which is a choral piece reminiscent of low-budget Wagner.\n\nIn some ways, these Shore pieces are the most memorable parts of these films for me, although this could be because I have the attention span of a small rodent.\n\nSearches on LimeWire and Gnutella are fruitless; I'm not sure these scores are even on CD, and even if they are, nobody's sharing them. (You wouldn't believe how impossible it's been to find a shared copy of Philip Glass's score for <i>The Hours</i>, and that one's recent and relatively popular!)\n\nIn fact, I'm pretty sure that <i>Looking for Richard</i> (Al Pacino's docu-fictional love letter to Shakespeare, Shakespearean acting and the conflict between American anti-aristocracy and--zzzzzz...) exists now only as a video tape I haven't accidentally stolen from Facets yet. No DVD yet, and certainly no soundtrack album on CD.\n\nThe problem with videotape is that, well, in order to get to the end title music I have to sit through <i>Looking for Richard</i>. Aidan Quinn aquits himself fairly decently as Richmond, but while Al Pacino is many things, my children, we find that King Richard III he most certainly is not. Winona Ryder's involvement is duly noted, but I don't remember her in the movie. I can remember the various British actors and scholars who talk about Shakespeare, and I remember various slow-motion shots of Pacino walking around on a basketball court. No Winona. The IMDb tells me she was in the movie, however, and I'm inclined to believe them.\n\nI don't want the movies. I will take their exit music, and sell the rest for scrap."

    body: "I'm watching <i>George Washington</i> tonight for what seems like the first time in ages. I'm sure I've plopped it into the DVD player at some point over the past year, but my last good memory of seeing it was showing it to Colin, a guy I had met at a Barnes &#38; Noble in Birmingham who was sitting in on my classes and staying at my place for a few days.\n\nI showed him this film and <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, discussing and studying them until the wee hours of the morning, when I simply couldn't stay awake anymore and remarked, 'jesus, you know you're getting old when you can't even manage an all-nighter anymore.'\n\nThe stream of my consciousness is drifting towards a memory of a freshman year all-nighter spent just talking with Amanda Granek in her dorm room, but we shall skip that memory for now, save it for a less cynical moment.\n\nRight now it's just me and the film, and the computer. (Jenny is present, of course, but off doing her own thing. She is in the self-contained world of her headphones, and I shall soon go into my own, I think.) My project is to try to think of songs I'd like to steal, and then stealing them.\n\n<i>\"When I go to the bathroom, I'd like to be proud of what happens.\"\n\"Hold on, now, there are two hot dogs with chili somewhere in my pantsuit.\"</i>\n\nSee, when memories come to me they are never specific or topical; just little shocks of memory that let me know that I existed before this moment. Of all my regrets, right now this minute I regret that I can't remember what Amanda and I talked about, or what Colin thought of the movie."

    body: "Through a typically circuitous process of thought, inspiration and LimeWire glitches, I'm listening to \"Philadelphia\" by Neil Young.\n\nI first heard the song on the soundtrack to the movie <i>Philadelphia</i>; it plays over the ending of the movie, the sequence right after the trial when Tom Hanks's character dies, his Gay Type friends are mourning him over fruit punch at his apartment and Denzel Washington's family comes to pay their respects.\n\nI'm told I'm unusual in this respect, but when I listen to pop music I generally don't notice the lyrics. (This accounts for my irrational love for Tori Amos.) My reaction to the song has nothing to do with what it's about, but rather with that scene. It's not tragic, because Tom Hanks just took his Anti-Gay Type bosses to the cleaners to an extent that belies the existence of the appeals process.\n\nAnd to be honest with ourselves, it's not a breathtakingly innovative sequence -- just a lot of characters, some we've met, some we haven't, remembering someone who has died and watching his childhood home movies. I think what makes it stick out is that song. The scene plays out with little or no audible dialogue, so that the Neil Young song is almost the only audio. And it's cheaply, pathetically effective."

But children's rights activists condemned the contest, saying that it reinforced Thailand's image as a haven for paedophiles. </blockquote>\n\nReally, this would be extra-funny just about anywhere in the world.

    title: "Too good to be true? That's because it's a lie."
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "AT&#38;T has just started pushing a new mobile phone service called GoPhone, which seems to be exactly the same as its usual mobile service, except for a few key points: &raquo; No credit check. &raquo; No contract. &raquo; No activation..."
    body: "AT&#38;T has just started pushing a new mobile phone service called <a href=\"http://www.attws.com/gophone/\" target=\"_blank\">GoPhone</a>, which seems to be exactly the same as its usual mobile service, except for a few key points:\n\n&raquo; No credit check.\n&raquo; No contract.\n&raquo; No activation fee.\n\nTheir cheapest GoPhone plan is \$19.99/mo for 80 anytime minutes with nationwide long distance and roaming included, and a shockingly reasonable price for additional minutes. An extra ten bucks nearly doubles your anytime minutes and adds on free unlimited nights and weekends.\n\nAT&#38;T's mMode mobile internet service is available for about \$4 monthly as part of the monthly fee. (Actually, you get a little bit of mMode no matter what you do -- the four bucks only grants you more access to more stuff at a slightly lower per-Kb rate.)\n\nCatch? Of course there is."
    extended: "GoPhone can only be billed to a credit or debit card; AT&#38;T is taking the savings from not having to deal with the risks of extending you credit (i.e., doing their own credit checks, contracts and billing) and passing them on in the form of a month-to-month commitment that (one presumes) is terminated once your card starts bouncing.\n\nThe trick is that this is still a prepaid phone, they're just giving you lower rates in exchange for monthly, recurring recharges. To wit: that \$20 plan that includes 80 minutes. If you read the fine print (and I have), you'll find that the per-minute rate for that plan is 25 cents. If you do the math (and I have), you find that 25 cents multiplied by 80 minutes is (ta-da!) \$20.\n\nThis is prepaid made up to look like a monthly plan: your fee is just a recurring recharge. This means that (presumably) if you don't use all of your virtual minutes (i.e., have some cash left over in your account at the end of the month), they can carry over to the next month.\n\nSo why are the rates so low, compared to regular prepaid?\n\nFor one thing, AT&#38;T is putting some faith in the fact that you have a usable Visa card that you're willing to put a recurring charge on. Since somebody -- either a bank or a credit card company -- had to give you that card based on either a decent credit history or your having deposited some cash, AT&#38;T can infer that your money is good and you stand a better chance of being a reliable customer than somebody paying cash for a prepaid phone.\n\nMeanwhile, if your credit card is declined, AT&#38;T isn't left in the lurch -- all that you're buying with that monthly fee is a prepaid recharge. You can only use the minutes you've already paid for, and if you're not good for a charge, it's the bank's problem. Not AT&#38;T's.\n\nAnother kicker: the GoPhone service works only on AT&#38;T's spiff new digital network, using only all-digital phones. Digital calls are cheaper to handle and easier to meter, whereas old-school cell phone networks cost more to operate.\n\nIf you get GoPhone, you're getting contract rates for the cheapest 20% of AT&#38;T's network in exchange for agreeing to automatic reloads on your prepaid balance. It's like if Starbucks would give you fifty-cent drinks, but only if you use your Starbucks Card, sign up for automatic reloads on the card and even then can only be served coffee after your card has cleared. And after all that, you can only have drip coffee (the cheapest thing to make). To get cappuccinos or mochas, you need a contract.\n\nAlso, GoPhone currently works only with one particular Nokia handset. I'd imagine that while this handset is not necessarily exclusive to GoPhone, the ones that will work with GoPhone are only available from AT&#38;T. So while you're free from activation fees or a credit check, you still have to pay \$90 for your phone.\n\nThis is not to say that GoPhone isn't a compelling idea. It's a compromise between prepaid wireless (crappy rates) and true month-to-month billing (contracts &#38; credit checks) that's structured in a way that gives many potential cell phone customers a much, much better deal while protecting AT&#38;T from getting stiffed. The prices are not bad, and if you don't travel to places where you might need to talk on a non-digital network or mind AT&#38;T choosing a dicky-looking phone for you, you're good to go.\n\nI am, however, not stupid. AT&#38;T is betting that many of their potential customers are, or at least are not very observant of the fine print. This is simply discounted prepaid which AT&#38;T is trying to pass off as some kind of contract-free month-to-month billing, which it kinda is, but Sprint PCS -- which has built a surprisingly stable business on being the only major wireless carrier not to require a contract -- offers the real deal.\n\nThe major difference is probably the credit check. If you can have a bank account, you can have a cell phone and not get jacked for the privilege."

    body: "Disney has announced that the release schedule for their Platinum Collection series of animated films on DVD -- their ten most popular, enduring titles given the deluxe two-disc treatment -- will be accelerated starting in March 2004.\n\nCurrently, Disney Platinum DVDs are released only once a year, generally in September or October, following a major IMAX release the previous Spring. The discs are then made available for a limited time (a year or less) before going on moratorium for ten years, or until they feel like selling it again.\n\nThe new idea is that Platinum Collection discs will now come out twice a year, in March and October, and will remain in print for two years before going bye-bye. Disney has said that this is because they believe that HD-DVD (the <em>next</em> format we'll all be buying into after HDTV becomes the standard in 2006) will take hold in the market sooner than expected, and they want to have a chance to go through a complete Platinum Collection cycle before doing this all over again with HD versions of the disc.\n\nWe will, as such, see DVD editions of the following Disney 'classics' within the next four years: <em>101 Dalmatians</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Bambi</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> and <em>Pinocchio</em>.\n\n<em>Snow White</em> and <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> have been released on DVD, with <em>The Lion King</em> scheduled for release later this year."

However, those of us attracted to the Matrix series for its skillful blending of chop-socky and philisophical sci-fi will be less than thrilled by this reviewer's take on the plot:\n\n<blockquote>WARNING: THIS PARAGRAPH IS ABOUT THE PLOT AND IT&#8217;S BORING AND THERE&#8217;S NO ASS-KICKING IN IT BUT I USE THE WORD &#8220;F**K&#8221; THREE TIMES TO HELP GET THROUGH IT </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I still don&#8217;t get the plot of the first one, and this one&#8217;s all talking about &#8220;choices&#8221; (over and over again to where you think you&#8217;re watching that f**king Chicktime network) and &#8220;prophecies&#8221; and especially words like &#8220;anomaly&#8221; and &#8220;exile&#8221; (and who the f**k even knows what those words mean?) and there&#8217;s this long speech at the end that I also didn&#8217;t get. Also, you find out all this deep stuff, like about The Cookie Lady from the first movie and they introduce all these other characters like a Key Guy and a Frenchie Dude and another Frenchie but guess what it&#8217;s okay &#8216;cuz the other Frenchie&#8217;s a chick and she&#8217;s got cleavage you could hide a rump roast in and also this ex-girlfriend of Murphus and there&#8217;s this new guy on the ship flying it around, I think he&#8217;s from OZ (don&#8217;t worry, no butt rape). And Neo and Memento Babe are all PDA every second, and they also &#8220;do it&#8221; and one time I thought I saw Memento Babe&#8217;s nip but it was one of those metal ring things that everyone&#8217;s got on &#8216;em so no jacking off when the DVD comes out.</blockquote>\n\nSee, this is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to be so vehement about something, wouldja at least try to learn the characters' names? Neo. Morpheus. Trinity. Is that so hard?\n\n<blockquote>Here&#8217;s my blurb if they&#8217;re putting blurbs in ads:  &#8220;MATRIX: KINGDOM OF ASS-KICKING is like if all of Anthrax&#8217;s albums formed into a hot chick who had to f**k you ten times a day or she gets pee-cancer.&#8221; </blockquote>\n\nOn second thought, I think I may wait until the second or third day to see it, just so I don't run into any heavy metal psychos who are coming to see if one can really hide a rump roast in Monica Bellucci's breasts.\n\nSigh. Thank god it'll only be playing in the snobby part of town...\n\nIn short: movie probably pretty good. Reviewer needs not to check his mail for a few days."

    body: "I am working on a paper on irony in Postmodernism while experiencing an early '90s kick. As such, I am listening to Alanis Morissette.\n\n<b>Today in the War To Serve Coffee Dammit:</b>\n\nA customer's order of \"two small iced coffees with caramel and whipped cream\" was led astray by the fact that the girl who took her order is (a) new to her job and (b) an idiot. (No, really, an idiot. I know it sounds far-fetched, but you haven't heard her talking on the telephone.)\n\nSo the job of Service Recovery (affectionately referred to as \"servicing the customer\" by, uh, me) fell to the Supervisor on Duty, who despite much experience in the coffee-slinging arena is new to the wonderful world of management. Before becoming a supervisor for Starbucks this individual has worked for such companies as Unisys and IBM, and is only now learning that consumers (that is to say, of coffee) do not like to be interrogated as to whether or not they are lying.\n\nThe appropriate response:\n\nME (dropping what I'm doing to nobly save the Supervisor from himself): \"--justtalkedtothegirlwhotookyourorder -- (breathes) -- and she didn't have any record of your order. I think she just sent it down wrong, or something -- she's still training and didn't ask us for help...I think you want two caramel lattes, right? Coffee, milk and caramel with whipped cream on top? Right? I'll have those right out.\"\n\nCUSTOMER: \"You should be a manager.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a guy scheduled to come in tomorrow morning to undergo his initiation as a New Partner called to say he was turning down the job. Good for you, buddy. I'll give <i>you</i> a call when I'm turning down the next job <i>I</i> get."

The regular, 'extra strength' Tylenol (or, if you prefer, Wal-leve) contains only 500 mg of acetamenophen, so this new product could be extremely useful for those of us seeking to chase away the pain and panic of modern life, not to mention those pesky headaches, chest and muscle pains. And think of how wonderful it could be for the ladies in your life around that sensitive time of the month?\n\nThere's just one small problem: if you're gonna take SuperTylenol you had better damned well need it, and have some backup plan for getting home if you're not there already. While the makers of the drug may have some kind of non-drowsy version in the works, this sure as hell ain't it. It won't put you to sleep, and I'm sure a good, strong cup of coffee may make all the difference in the world.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that about 30-90 minutes after you take the recommended dose of SuperTylenol, you will have trouble staying awake. You may never actually fall asleep for any period of time, but you will drift in and out of sleep for about half an hour, which looks really silly if you're sitting in class learning about Motion Math.\n\nAnd if such a spectacle were to be followed by, say, a nosebleed, why, that would seem almost suspicious."

    body: "Some weeks ago I had one of those crazed epiphanies of mine where I thought, gee, wouldn't it be cool if someone took a full-featured publishing system like Movable Type and built a web hosting service around it. You wouldn't have to worry about organizing your directory structure or other vagaries of traditional website design -- you'd just get your blogging software and a database, and administer everything from a web-based front end, and it would be very nice and easy and flexible.\n\nSure if <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben &amp; Mena</a> don't have an industrial spy among the several dozen employees of Voices In David's Head Ltd.: the creators of Movable Type (MT) today announced <a href=\"http://www.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TypePad</a>, a turnkey personal publishing service (read: web host for blogging).\n\n<blockquote>TypePad expands weblog publishing to include integration of text, photos and other media content. The combination of simplicity and comprehensive features will make TypePad the first tool that will empower users, beginners and experts alike, to reach the full potential of the weblog medium. (<a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/press/six_apart_ltd_announces_the_typepad.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Press release from Six Apart</a>)</blockquote>\n\nSix Apart will announce pricing and a full feature set for TypePad next month, and will follow that announcement with a public beta of the service.\n\nNote that TypePad is a new for-pay product <i>in addition to</i> Six Apart's upcoming Movable Type Pro and existing Movable Type.\n\nNote also that I don't actually believe Six Apart has stolen any idea of mine. I only observe that great (or at least semi-competent) minds often think alike."

    body: "Meanwhile, one evening recently I asked a salesguy at the Borders Books' Lincoln Park branch (Tom Wolfe gives it three 'huh-huuuuuuunnnnnnggggghhh!!\"s up) where I could find <i>McSweeneys</i>. He led me to a McSweeney's-published compilation of genre stories by major authors including Michael Chabon and Neil Gaiman. This, I believe, was the text of the mythical <i>McSweeney's #10</i>, which came with a DVD if you were a subscriber, and came in a cheesy-looking Vintage Contemporaries paperback if you were not.\n\n\"Anyone who tells you different is just frontin',\" he said, evidently proud of his knowledge of the One, True Current McSweeneys.\n\nI didn't buy it, as most McSweeneys publications (including the new, non-Eggers-headed monthly magazine <i>The Believer</i>) are as nice to look at as they are to read, and this had none of that Eggers-influenced type design and whatnot. It was just a book, designed seemingly by a colorblind intern whose uncle got him a job at a major publishing house.\n\nI'm sorry, but it was ugly. As we say in Alabama (paraphrased), \"don't you buy no ugly books.\"\n\nSalesguy was operating under several misconceptions:\n\n<b>1.</b> A subscription to McSweeney's <i>does not cost \$250</i>. It costs \$65. This makes no difference to an individual if the most you can afford to spend on your magazine subscriptions is <i>It Came With The Computer</i>, but I expect accurate depictions of unattainable products from my booksellers.\n\n<b>2.</b> Regardless of the number of tattoos on one's forearms, the term 'frontin'' is generally not in the retail vocabulary. (Except in Wicker Park, where one often finds such polite merchant terminology as 'asshole' on bookstore signage.) \"Providing bad information\", \"misrepresenting\" and \"lying like a dog\" are perfectly acceptable substitutes.\n\n<b>3.</b> Am I expected to believe that people actually <i>read</i> McSweeney's?\n\nI could have looked for the <i>One, True McSweeney's #10</i> while I was brunching in Wicker Park yesterday, but does one -- especially an individual dressed in a clean, silver-gray, collared piece of Lincoln Parkiana -- just walk into Myopic Books and ask, \"hey, where can I find, uh, McSweeneys?\" Is that deck? I would suppose not.\n\nThe quest continues. Next stop: Tower Records."

I ended up with something that vaguely resembles music, and features Madonna's voice. The track is, however, fuckless.\n\nMy ongoing efforts to be thwarted by Madonna have proven equally fruitless. This will likely be the extent of my relationship with the new Madonna album, as the review in today's <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> (by a reviewer who called her last album, <i>Music</i>, a masterpiece) is pretty much a smackdown."

    body: "The temperature in Chicago is \"80&deg; F, feels like 80&deg; F,\" according to Weather.com. As I was leaving the house in t-shirt and shorts for only the second time in 2003, Jenny asked if maybe I was underdressed. In actuality, while walking down Michigan Avenue I was dying for a bottle of water because it's so darn hot. Less than a week ago, you see, we had 40&deg; and snow, and even though it was annoying I said at the time that \"a month from now we'll be wishing for it to be this cool again.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as I'm starting to swelter in this whopping 80 degrees of heat, I'm thinking: \"One month from now I'll be begging for it to be this temperature again.\"\n\nWe have learned that the 7-Eleven at Wabash and Madison in the Loop serves Dr. Pepper Red Fusion in its Big Gulp machine. It's actually more of a darker red, like what you would get if you mixed day-old blood with soda water and served it up in a soda fountain. Not that I would know anything about that, of course."

    body: "This past week one of my classes embarked on a time-honored pastime of the SAIC filmmaking program, the group shoot. My classmates were given the task of adapting the opening sequence of John Huston's <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> to our particular (or is that peculiar?) sensibilities, then filming it, trying to keep not only certain elements of the scene but also the camera angles fairly close to the source.\n\nThe original scene is a dialogue between Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), his latest client and, later, his partner. As adapted by my high school classmate Austin Meredith -- whose collegiate career has tended to favor surreal sci-fi videos featuring his various papier-mache alien creations and imagery of consumption, invasion and hunting -- Sam is now a nefarious doctor, his partner now a grapefruit-headed videographer and the client now a shaggy-haired gentleman infected by...the parasites.\n\n<blockquote>MARY: \"PARASITES?!\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>SAM: The worms grow to be about six feet long. They...have a smooth, white and porous skin. This injection will slow them down for a few days.</blockquote>\n\n(Sam injects Mary with a long needle. No, longer.)\n\n<blockquote>MARY: What can I do?!</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>SAM: Nothing. When the worms reach maturation they will osmotically bore holes in your stomach. Send your children to stay at a relative's house because the worms will be very hungry when they escape. And do not eat anything because that will make the escape of the worms much more painful. Now I want you to go home and wait.</blockquote>\n\n(Mary exits.)\n\n<blockquote>SAM, to Kraniak: Have her followed. We can catch the worms and sell them on the black market.</blockquote>\n\nI volunteered to capture our MiniDV footage onto a hard disk, then copy it back out to DVD-ROMs for the class to use in an editing exercise this week. With this access, not only have I already crafted my own director's cut of the epic saga of man-playing-woman versus osmotic worm, but also begun rewriting the script because I felt like playing with Final Draft for a while:\n\n(Lazarus inserts the long, pointy instrument into Mary's rectum. She gasps.)\n\n<blockquote>MARY: I was promised that there would be no anal probes!</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>LAZARUS: This is not an anal probe! It's a rectal explorer!</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>MARY: Oh, okay.</blockquote>\n\n(He inserts the rectal explorer even deeper into her...)"

    body: "CNN.com reports tonight that a surprising number of people -- either journalists, armchair generals or honest-to-god U.S. troops -- are blogging about the war even as they are out there fighting it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lt-smash.us/\" target=\"_blank\">LT SMASH</a> has the distinction of being both (a) written by an American GI fighting as part of Operation Iraqi Takeover and (b) named after a less-than-flattering <i>Simpsons</i> reference. The upshot of this is that yes, Virginia, the Army watches <i>The Simpsons</i> too.\n\n<a href=\"http://sgtstryker.com.cr.sabren.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sgt. Stryker's Daily Briefing</a> eschews both hard-hitting dispatches from the front and informed commentary on the progress of the war for what appears to be a facile catalog of Wired News articles and Bad Things The Lefties Are Doing To Our Troops Back Home. In other words, a blog.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.blogsofwar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blogs of War</a> is by far the slickest of these sites, begging for cash through both a PayPal donation box and by selling stuff through CafePress. It's also one of the more comprehensive and open-minded sites, although the authors' pro-war slant informs it all. They've even taken time off to post some reports about Canada's SARS (superflu to you) outbreak, news which does indeed concern anyone who lives in North America, has been getting their news exclusively from the Fox War Channel and has a vested interest in not dying a horrible, painful death.\n\nMeanwhile, today's Red Streak (if you don't know what this is, go thank God you don't live in Chicago. No, do it now.) is running a typically truncated report on which media sources have traded objectivity for access. Fox News seems to be the biggest offender, often peppering their hard-hitting, honest coverage with phrases like \"we\", \"our troops\" and \"the enemy\".\n\n(As if that waving American flag in the upper left of the screen didn't leave a big enough hint.)\n\nTIME Magazine's Big Spring War Issue is also getting in on the act, laying bare the compromises the networks' \"embedded\" journalists are making in order to be travelling with the coalition forces in Iraq.\n\nThe international consensus is clear: if you want objectivity, watch/read the BBC. France and Germany, however, have threatened to veto any resolution agreeing that the BBC is the only outlet covering the war objectively, and instead want coverage where reporters sit in the studio and talk about the war in broad, hypothetical terms.\n\nOh, and speaking of <a href=\"http://www.canoe.ca/TorontoNews/ts.ts-03-27-0002.html\" target=\"_blank\">not-with-a-bang, but-with-a-whimper</a>..."

It has not been moved -- if so, the webmaster could use Error 310 (Permanent Redirect) to tell you where the new location is -- it is simply gone, perhaps never to return.\n\n<blockquote>We've all been brainwashed into believing that all resources should be permanent, which simply isn't true. Embracing HTTP error code 410 means embracing the impermanence of all things.</blockquote>\n\nAnyone who's used a search engine has gotten used to the idea that when you click a link, the page you're seeking may or may not still be there anymore. You could end up at a porn ad server that has purchased an old site's domain name. Most often, however, you get the good old 404.\n\nImplementing 410 errors would be karmically correct and true to the spirit of the original HTTP spec (which seeks to promote trustworthy hyperlinks by providing accurate error codes), but the user experience would ultimately be the same: telling the user that they cannot have what they have asked for.\n\nIf it's specificity we're after, perhaps we need a new 40x code: I'm Too Lazy To Update My Links Or Provide A Redirect."

Subscribers will have unlimited access for the entire term of their subscription, while purchasing a copy on a newsstand will grant you access \"for the duration of the magazine edition [you] purchase.\" AOL members, of course, will have unlimited access as part of their subscription.\n\nSo at any rate, as an AOL member who finds the recipes and homemaking tips in Real Simple to be compelling, but ultimately impractical, this does not affect me."

    body: "I have reclaimed my title; I am sorry to announce that there was no prize winner in this year's Oscars Game. There were several strong contenders, but no one who could beat my score of 82 points (out of a possible 150, not including Super-Bonuses).\n\nThe margin could have been even closer had this not been one of the strangest Oscar nights in a long while. Academy voters shocked the world by giving three surprise awards to <i>The Pianist</i>, including Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Director (Roman Polanski) and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nComing into tonight, it was believed that Polanski was too controversial a choice (after the whole rape of a minor thing that prevents him from ever entering the United States again; presenter Harrison Ford accepted the Oscar on his behalf), that Brody was too obscure and that the script would be pummeled by either <i>The Hours</i> or <i>Adaptation</i>.\n\nIn each category my own guess would be that this is a classic case of two major contenders cancelling each other out, leaving an unexpected (but in this case, incredibly deserving) winner by default. The only downside is that five minutes I spent thinking that maybe they would shock and awe everybody by giving the Best Picture trophy to <i>Pianist</i>, or practically any movie besides \"Chicago\".\n\nAnd speaking of shock and awe, Pedro Almodovar -- the Spanish Woody Allen -- won the Best Original Screenplay award for <i>Talk to Her</i>, a total surprise that's only slightly less strange than the Writers Guild giving their similar award to a documentary. In short, Hollywood clearly wants Todd Haynes to crawl into his corner of Julianne Moore's basement and die.\n\nSpeaking of that music video writ large, it did indeed win Best Picture, as well as five other awards. Now let us never speak of this again.\n\nAnother surprise was the win by musician Marshall Mathers (better known to you as Eminem), whose 'fuck the Oscars' attitude didn't keep the Academy from giving the Best Original Song trophy to \"Lose Yourself\". True to his word, Eminem didn't bother to show up, sending co-composer Luis Resto to serve up forty-five seconds of spirited Eminem apologia, as well as show off his decidedly unglamorous duds.\n\nIn a delightful turn of events, <i>Spirited Away</i> -- the wonderful, often surreal masterpiece by Japanimation maestro Miyazaki -- beat out the more widely seen <i>Lilo & Stitch</i> and <i>Ice Age</i> to win Best Animated Feature.\n\nOne development that was not at all unexpected was the awarding of the Best Documentary Feature statuette to uberlefty Michael Moore's antigun documentary <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>, which led to something else also not at all surprising: Moore's forty-five second diatribe against President Bush (also the War, but mostly Bush, who he called a \"fictional president\"), which prompted boos (and some cheering) from the audience and a remark shortly thereafter by host Steve Martin that Teamsters were \"currently helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.\"\n\nOn the whole the presenters and winners stuck to Oscars producer Gil Cates's rules for the evening: acceptance speeches limited to 45 seconds and five thank-yous per person, with limited (if any) commentary about the Current Unpleasantness.\n\nThe notable exception was Best Actor winner Adrien Brody, who began by embracing presenter Halle Berry in a manner excusable only because he was in shock, followed by a vaguely coherent, whopping 2-3 minute (!) speech where he thanked at least fifteen people and called for a peaceful resolution to the aforementioned Unpleasantness, which prompted a standing ovation from the same crowd that booed Michael Moore offstage."

    body: "This evening U.S. President George W. Bush told the American people they can stop saying '<i>if</i> we go to war...', <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/2003/03/17/international/17CND-NATI.html\" target=\"_blank\">announcing</a> that unless Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, his sons and his entire regime abdicate and leave Iraq within forty-eight hours, a quarter-million American troops (aided by friends from Britain, Spain, Australia and other allies) will do it for them.\n\n<blockquote>As for the notion that a super power like the United States should not wage war unless it is attacked first, Mr. Bush said that would be folly in the age of deadly weapons and ruthless terrorists. \"It is not self-defense,\" Mr. Bush said. \"It is suicide.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Bush said America and its allies have no choice but to move on Iraq, unless Mr. Hussein steps aside. Mr. Hussein and his cronies have been reckless in the Middle East, are in league with terrorists and are driven by \"a deep hatred for America,\" Mr. Bush said. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>At one point, the president vowed, \"Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course for safety.\" (<a href=\"http://nytimes.com/2003/03/17/international/17CND-NATI.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> via Gleaner)</blockquote>\n\nEarlier today the U.S., British and Spanish ambassadors to the United Nations withdrew a proposed Security Council resolution which would have declared Iraq to be in violation of the UN's weapons inspection process, thus endorsing the use of force by member states (read: the U.S.) to ensure yada yada yada. Anyway, they withdrew it, after France and Germany vowed to veto it, and other, non-permanent Council members (who do not have a veto) vowed not to support it.\n\nNow, what does this mean for you, Practical Reader?\n\nThe national terror alert level has been raised to Orange (again), and tonight we've told basically the entire Muslim world that they're gonna be our bitch, and they're gonna <i>love</i> it.\n\nIf I were Osama bin Laden, I'd be sending out recruiting tapes like they were AOL discs, and stocking up on nylons, chewing gum and anthrax spores to issue to the troops. If I were Kim Jong Il, I'd write the word \"nucular\" on the side of a cardboard box, go on national TV and just let the good times roll.\n\nMe, I plan on working on my website and going to bed. As you see.\n\n(Zzzzzzzzz.)"

    body: "Tonight we have finally gotten our cable TV reconnected after a two-month dry spell, and this time we're sticking to just basic cable, at least until the money situation improves. Then again, we may not ever have to upgrade our cable to a nicer package, as there are apparently only two channels we ever watched that don't fall within the comfy confines of Comcast's cheapest package.\n\nI find it incredible that Food Network is a basic channel, but CNN is not, nor are Fox News or MSNBC. (CNN Headline News is the only cable news channel we get.) Bravo, with its independent movies and Canadian sitcoms, is a basic cable station. And we get Sci-Fi and Comedy Central but not USA, TNT , TNN or TBS. This is a good thing but for the loss of Law & Order Monday Marathons.\n\nI thought that perhaps the cable guys had made a mistake -- Comcast had told me that our \$17/mo cable TV would include only local broadcast stations -- until I saw which channels were not available. We don't get major AOL Time Warner-owned channels or any MTV Network besides MTV itself. We don't get the Disney Channel or ABC Family, which is owned by Disney.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense: Time Warner would charge the higher 'expanded basic' rate for their channels because they have their own cable business of which Comcast is a competitor. (I wonder if Cartoon Network and CNN are basic channels on Time Warner Cable?) Disney networks's would be better-than-basic because Disney thinks anything with their brand names on it is worth more money than it really ought to be. And MTV is basic because it always has been -- it debuted before there was even such a thing as 'expanded basic'.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Discovery makes money by keeping its costs low, and is (I presume) able to sell their channels for less without affecting the bottom line. This is brilliant business because on some cable systems, Discovery channels like Animal Planet can run without competitiion from more glossy kid-oriented channels like Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon.\n\nAt any rate, I am pleasantly surprised."

The current incarnation is perhaps the most tolerable, but the format -- a talk show with constant comments from the studio audience, peppered with e-mails and IMs from viewers at home -- becomes really, really unbearable after a while. The interviewers don't ask tough enough questions, and the armchair cowboys sending the IMs generally have nothing to add but expressions of their ignorance."

    body: "In the just-posted entry on Stan Brakhage's death, there is a link to more information surrounding the filmmaker's passing. It is hosted on Fred Camper's website.\n\nI also mention an upcoming Criterion Collection DVD compilation of Brakhage's work. The essay for that edition is critic Fred Camper.\n\nAnd I just ran into this posting by Camper -- who is not only a noted film critic, but also taught a class on Hollywood Melodrama two years ago at SAIC which I took and largely enjoyed -- on the Frameworks mailing list:\n\n<blockquote>I think that it's theoretically possible to choose a sampling rate [i.e., for digital reproduction of filmed images] at which no human being could tell the difference in a blind A/B test between a print made from a digital file and one made only from celluloid. And ultimately high resolution digital files are likely the only way to preserve film for the long term, though such preservation efforts might themselves fail due to changes in technology, computers 100 years from now being unable to read today's files, etc. But at least theoretically high-resolution files with lossless copying might give us something close to the original. We already know that with celluloid several generations removed from the original there's significant quality loss, and we already know that celluloid originals turn to vinegar eventually. </blockquote>\n\nI find these comments surprising, as Camper is a notorious video-hater. He has, in fact, been called the only \"real\" film critic in the United States for his steadfast refusal to watch a video transfer of any film meant to be shown on film, at least for a first critical screening.\n\nI can ultimately accept this very practical viewpoint coming from a man with a well-known desire (not to mention a vested interest) for the survival of the cinema in <i>some</i> form. This just requires a little bit of mental readjustment."

    body: "Ain't It Cool News is <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=14671\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that legendary experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage, whose 400 films are revered by film scholars while remaining unwatched by most moviegoers (myself included) has died.\n\n<blockquote>Most of your readers probably don't know who Stan Brakhage is, or maybe they know him only from his acting turn in CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL. But they know - for instance - David Fincher, who was highly influenced by Brakhage's films in the credits of SEVEN, or Oliver Stone, who took Brakhage's layering of images and manipulation of film texture and ran with it. Or that tape in THE RING, which certainly bears some marks of Brakhage's style. Or the many filmmakers, both experimental and narrative, who were influenced by Brakhage's modest means of production to attempt to make their own films in a similar manner outside the studio apparatus. </blockquote>\n\nDetails about Brakhage's passing are posted on <a href=\"http://www.fredcamper.com/Brakhage/McPherson.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Camper's website</a>.\n\nThose wanting a better glimpse at some of Brakhage's work without going to the extreme of finding a cinematheque that is showing them (or a film library that even has them) will soon have an alternative: The Criterion Collection is releasing <i><a href=\"http://www.criterionco.com/asp/release.asp?id=184\" target=\"_blank\">on Brakhage</a></i>, a single-disc compilation of 26 Brakhage films this May.\n\nNote my use of the terms 'cinematheque' and 'film library' -- Brakhage is obscure not only because he eschewed traditional methods of filmmaking. His distribution has been limited to avant-garde venues like SAIC's Siskel Film Center and various art museums, his audience consisting of truly hard-core cineastes and art critics for whom filmmaking is a visual, not dramatic or literary, art. And if there's a filmmaker who embodies this way of looking at and making films, it's Brakhage.\n\nFrom the blurb on Criterion's site:\n\n<blockquote>Challenging all taboos in his exploration of &#8220;birth, sex, death, and the search for God,&#8221; Brakhage has turned his camera on explicit lovemaking, childbirth, even actual autopsy. Many of his most famous works pursue the nature of vision itself and transcend the act of filming. Some, including the legendary Mothlight , were made without using a camera at all.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Instead, Brakhage has pioneered the art of making images directly on film itself&#8211;&#8211;starting with clear leader or exposed film, then drawing, painting, and scratching it by hand. Treating each frame as a miniature canvas, Brakhage can produce only a quarter- to a half-second of film a day, but his visionary style of image-making has changed everything from cartoons and television commercials to MTV music videos and the work of such mainstream moviemakers as Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, and Oliver Stone.</blockquote>\n\nI don't feel at all compelled to go take a class on Brakhage or anything (my school does, in fact, offer one), but I'm looking forward to this upcoming Criterion disc with great interest.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B000087EYF/demareesworld\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the disc at Amazon</a>"

Add to that an on-board Jackie Chan movie and the potential to learn Chinese through osmosis, and it&#8217;s clear why these lines are becoming an alternative to Amtrak and Greyhound.&#8217;</blockquote>\n\nSuch comments are typical New York Times: bemused, about as far from reality as Risen and his fellow passengers were from home when their Chinatown Bus was forced off the road in Maryland and their Chinese driver couldn't tell them what the problem was, how long they would be stuck, whether they were going to die, et al.\n\nRead the <a href=\"http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/editorial/lost_in_translation.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> for the harrowing details.\n\nSide notes: For some reason, reading this story crashed Safari on such a profound level that I'm being forced to change my default browser to Camino for the remainder of the afternoon.\n\nAdditionally, does Meg Hourihan's sudden transformation from Silicon Valley cognoscenta into a living, weblogging extension of the New York City Tourism Board amuse anyone besides me?"

    body: "Dave Kehr <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/movies/09KEHR.html\" target=\"_blank\">writes in the Old Gray Lady</a> today about the Academy's slowness in picking up on the digital revolution, which starts to sound like a think piece about the abortive attempt by New Line Cinema to get an Oscar nomination for Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i>.\n\n<blockquote>Though Mr. Serkis ultimately wasn't nominated, the academy announced that his work would indeed be eligible in the supporting-actor category. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>So would that make the lovable talking mouse who starred in \"Stuart Little 2\" eligible as well? Apparently not. Although the academy has remained silent on this central issue, their guidelines suggest that having a human armature is essential to being considered for an acting prize. Because there was no motion-capture model for Stuart Little (the figure was composed out of geometric shapes on the computer screen), Stuart is deemed a fiction, while Gollum is ruled a performance. And so, despite the preponderance of live actors and location shooting in \"Stuart Little 2,\" the film was shuffled off to the animation category, where it failed to win a place on the final ballot. </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But being fictional is not, in and of itself, a reason to be barred from Oscar consideration. Ask Donald Kaufman (or try to). The fictional twin brother of the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, Donald is credited as the co-writer of \"Adaptation,\" and his name will appear alongside Charlie's on any statuettes that might come his way (although the academy, willing to play along with the joke only so far, has also announced that should Mr. Kaufman win, only one statuette will be awarded). </blockquote>\n\nI don't know about you, but this sounds like the Academy is <i>extremely</i> savvy to the advent of digital characters and postmodern billing. If indeed Gollum would have been eligible for an acting Oscar, even if he didn't end up nominated (which is simply a matter of popular vote -- the public speculation over whether Serkis <i>could</i> be nominated probably hurt him, but ultimately wouldn't have changed anything), that's a more progressive viewpoint than I would have expected.\n\n<blockquote>Academy rules specify that 75 percent of a film must use animated effects for it to qualify for the animation category. That's a condition that \"The Two Towers\" almost certainly fulfills (not that I've seen it with a stopwatch in hand), given the ubiquity of animated supporting characters, digitally retouched photography and vast castles, caverns and fantasy landscapes spun entirely out of pixels. But no. \"The Two Towers\" is real; \"Ice Age\" (which uses the same technology to create its backgrounds, and which was nominated this year for animated feature) is not.</blockquote>\n\nActually, Dave, <i>The Two Towers</i> is largely real. Even some of the more unbelievable landscapes were achieved by compositing real elements, and 'digital grading' (the digital tinting process used to give the film its often unnecessarily blue look) does not make for an animated film. It has, in fact, been used on many films in the past and nobody else would question their realness, even if Elijah Wood does give us all our doubts.\n\n<blockquote>Speaking of \"Gangs of New York,\" Martin Scorsese's film will probably prove to be one of the last historical spectacles to be filmed entirely on built sets. </blockquote>\n\nWell, this is just stupid. True, Scorsese could probably have saved some cash, but it wouldn't have been the same for Scorsese, the actors or the finished product. Day-Lewis, DiCaprio and company would have been acting in front of a blue screen, and it would have showed -- assuming, of course, they would still have even agreed to do the movie. The millions spent made for a better movie.\n\nAnd <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, Kehr's current poster child for digital cinema, was mostly filmed on real landscapes or built sets. Even the bigger things which could not have been built to scale were done as models, so that there would be <i>some</i> feeling of realness to them.\n\nKehr's musings on the future of art direction ignore the key fact that <i>Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i> -- which was filmed on as many digital sets as its recent sequel, <i>Attack of the Clones</i> -- <i>was</i> nominated for an art direction Oscar. Digital sets <i>are</i> considered traditional art direction -- the precedent for this has been set."

Then you find some Topica archives of my various mailing lists. Then you find genealogy charts for various David Demarees who lived in the 17th and 18th Centuries, most of whom appear to have died trying to make it to America.\n\nThen there's a guy named David Demaree who posts the following to the Texas SportsGuide Fishing Forum:\n\n<blockquote>Subject: Fishing Spot 4 YMCA Troop?\nDate: 18-09-2002\nAuthor: David Demaree\nReply Wanted: Looking for stock pond or small lake to take small troop of local YMCA Y-Guides (approx six 7-8 yr old boys) to learn how to fish.

Call David (214) 555-9790 or e-mail david.demaree@fy.com Thanks very much.</blockquote>\n\nThe first result from practicalmadness.com is the eighth one down, and a broken link anyways.

    body: "<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/news/879490.asp?cp1=1\" target=\"_blank\">MSNBC reports</a> that not only is Dr. Pepper launching their own MT blog to promote Raging Cow, the company's new line of milk-plus drinks, but they are recruiting \"key-influence bloggers\" to help start a grass-roots marketing campaign in return for swag.\n\nTo me, the phrase 'key influence blogger' suggests that they've co-opted Kottke, Hourihan or a Trott. But I'm an old fogey; they're actually thinking of the authors of popular teeny blogs, who are being flown to Dr. Pepper's Dallas headquarters accompanied by their parents to be inducted into the Bovine Order.\n\nDr. Pepper has not released any information regarding exactly which <i>sites</i> will be participating in this viral marketing campaign, although MSNBC quotes \"Nicole, 18, a Louisiana high-school senior with a popular blog\" as saying that she and her fellow moobloggers are \"independent and can advertise Raging Cow the way we want.\"\n\nDPSU hopes that their moobloggers will &#8220;be part of the &#8216;in the know&#8217; crowd&#8221; and prove influential in hooking teeny-boppers and their older siblings on glorified chocowit milk.\n\nYou will note that I'm having way too much fun calling these children 'moobloggers'."

    description: "Certain individuals who have been written about on this site have found a need to not only respond, but to spam this site with comments. Then, days later, to comment again. This is entirely cool, and I will now take..."
    body: "<a href=\"http://whoisayiam.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Certain individuals</a> who have been <a href=\"/weblog/2003/Feb/week_of_Feb_23.php#000294\">written about</a> on this site have found a need to not only respond, but to spam this site with comments. Then, days later, to comment again. This is entirely cool, and I will now take a few moments to address this gentleman's concerns.\n\nBefore I begin, in the interests of full disclosure I should tell you that I have a 'Valley Girl' text filter installed which is designed to make the writing of anyone who comments on my blog look really, really stupid. I have decided, because I am lazy, to use this version of the comments rather than dig the original, untainted text out of my database. So please do not let my amusingly destructive tendencies detract from the power of the words.\n\nThis individual, who we will call \"D.H.\", writes:\n\n<blockquote>dude, i'm a bitchin' fan of david.  i mean, he's a person i totally look up to and stuff.  anywayz, and i'd just like to say that i totally totally agree with everythin' he wrote about dan.  cuz david's so smart, yo.  that's why we're friends and shit.  like soulmates.  but, to be fair, i asked dan what he thought too.  anywayz, lemme break it down for ya.</blockquote>\n\nAww, that's so nice of you to say that.\n\n<blockquote>(dan's response: i've always wondered why those who have undergone traumatic experiences must shoulder thuh burden of providin' others with a grander appreciation for their lives.  seems a touch unfair, no?)</blockquote>\n\nYes, but why else would you shoulder the burden of watching a movie about your traumatic experience upon your classmates and dear viewers if not to provide some grander appreciation of <i>something</i>? We (that is, the class) are watching in order to troubleshoot any editing problems you're having, to give you some feedback as to where it's working and where it's not, and to provide you with emotional support during this difficult time of creation and expression.\n\nMe, I generally drop the last bit; I've never gotten much support from anyone in the making of my work, and see my role as that of curmudgeonly troubleshooter. This may be a commercial (or even 'Hollywood') sentiment, but I think that to put your audience through your experience without some kind of payoff at the end is to cheat them. The payoff doesn't have to be all warm and fuzzy -- it can be ironic, it can be funny, it can be really, really mean, but it has to be <i>something</i>.\n\n<blockquote>indeed [the audience principle] may be true, but perhaps not in thuh vindictive manner with which david paints it.  i had no intentions for my video to edify thuh masses, or break new philosophical ground in humanity's unfailin' attempts to better understand ourselves.  i only intended to create a subjective document of an individual experience--which, last i checked, still remains a valid form of artistic expression.</blockquote>\n\nYes, it is very subjective. Yes, that is valid. But I don't think it's working, and I think that <i>the piece</i> (NOT the artist, NOT the experience) will be misconstrued. You say you intend for it to be taken as reportage, but it operates as more of a confessional, with all the emotional and stylistic baggage that accompanies that. It'll be taken as the filmic equivalent of emo, and I don't think you want that.\n\nFurthermore, I don't want to watch that. It comes off like the whining of a guy who has too much going on in the here and now to be worried about something like that if it didn't mean something. I was in a major car accident four months ago, which I survived only to come home to bill collectors and problems at work. I'm well aware that life doesn't provide meaning or satisfaction. I am further aware that it is not your job to provide entertainment or even catharsis. But if you don't think it's supposed to mean anything, why have you made a piece about it?\n\n<blockquote>i find it difficult for me to sit back and allow david's readers to believe that his sudden espousal of thuh 'hiv-is-not-a-death-sentence' position to be entirely genuine.  i have worked with survivors of hiv.  i'm fully aware that one can live a moderately healthy, happy, and long life with thuh disease.  perhaps my video does take a fairly existentialist view in that all sufferin' remains, in thuh grand scheme of thin's, somewhat futile, and that a grand overarchin' moral that one can glean from it does not exist--yet this in just no way means that my video propagates a myth about hiv that i myself don't even believe to be true.  and besides, everyone thinks irrationally when thuh threat of a life-changin' illness, specifically aids, presents itself in one's life, no?  it is like wow!  only this momentary irrationality that i wanted to convey in my video.</blockquote>\n\nD.H., you explain yourself very rationally. And I believe you. But the piece is not about momentary irrationality. It is about death. I call it how I see it.\n\nMore than anything, Dan, I'm frustrated by the sheer number of things the piece touches on, is about, raises. Last Wednesday's critique was a typical art-school rhetoric-fest, where some learned, intelligent people tried to pass off observations as insight, and you accommodated them with rhetoric.\n\nYou say it's just a document, but your piece is very irresponsible even if you are not, and just because you can explain that away in the classroom or here on the web doesn't mean that your film is any better.\n\nOh, and I know you called it a trope. That part I embellished because I thought it would be funnier. Remember funny? Remember fiction? I think this is my problem with your piece -- on the screen, it all becomes fiction. You have created something. It is not simply reportage. And I think that the fact that it is true has blinded you to the fact that it is a movie.\n\nI will now also confess that there are moments that I loved. I think that your sequence with the prescription bottle and the chess board is masterful -- simply one of the best cinematic moments I've seen in a while. It exemplified another thing you mentioned in the critique, which was an economy of images -- your pictures speak much more eloquently than your words. I didn't much care for your self-interview scene, but that's just my own personal taste.\n\nI agree totally with what Caroline was saying -- cut back on the narration and allow the images to do your work for you. You're smothering us with your voice.\n\nAs for your decision on Sunday to abandon your blog while you sort out the personal issues you've been neglecting by writing it...trust me, you'll be back.\n\nYou have a definite confessional streak, it comes out in your blog, and the immediacy of that outlet will lure you back. There is nothing wrong with using a blog to get over stuff. Such writing is cathartic, and whatever is motivating you, it can't make that any less useful.\n\nIf you think you need some distance, fine. But your blog will be back. And if Blogger ever gets too limiting for you, e-mail me, because it's a good blog and I'd be happy to set you up here at Practical."

    body: "It's about four months old, but Anil Dash's webzine has <a href=\"http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/microsofts_weblog_software.php\" target=\"_blank\">an interesting article</a> about a little-known Microsoft product (SharePoint) which can be used as server-side blogging software in the vein of Movable Type and Blogger. That's not its intended purpose, but you could do it.\n\n<blockquote>SharePoint Team Services (STS) is a workgroup-based or project-based intranet server, similar to what the original Pyra application was trying to be. Perhaps the best illustration of this similarity is Microsoft's inclusion of Team Services in the current version of Project Server . But even without the project management features, STS distinguishes itself with a focus on document management, contact management, and integration with Office stalwarts such as Outlook. The critical feature of STS, though, is a what's referred to as \"lists\". </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Lists, in a word, are weblogs. </blockquote>\n\nThe main interest of this piece is the revelation that yes, Microsoft's server software can be made to blog, even if Microsoft has yet to acknowledge the blogging phenomenon on a consumer level. (This writer finds it funny that Microsoft's latest attempt at expanding their consumer offerings, threedegrees, combines IM and P2P music sharing -- the next big things of 2000 and 2001, respectively.)\n\nDash concludes that Microsoft is not at all poised to become a player in the weblogging world, and I very much agree -- SharePoint is business-oriented software with one blog-friendly feature, runs only on Windows servers and in recent years Microsoft has been so concerned with milking their enterprise cash cow for all it's worth that their ability to invent and market new consumer products is practically nonexistent.\n\nHell, even the last consumer version of Windows has failed to make much of an impact due to Great White's insistence on bloating the OS with features that are either unnecessary or unnecessarily complex. (That said, Windows XP is the best version of Windows yet. I just wish I could run it on my three-year-old laptop.)\n\nAnd Microsoft's first foray into consumer electronics -- the Xbox -- gets mad props for being in many ways technologically superior to the PlayStation2. They said the same thing, however, about Betamax tapes. Business-wise, the Xbox is a failure that only a company as huge as Microsoft would be willing to write off, let alone survive.\n\nNow, how did a piece about SharePoint lead me to the Xbox? My point is that the time is long over when consumers and open-source types have to worry about Microsoft invading their space. It has become clear that Microsoft is losing touch, and apart from their traditional empires (Windows and Internet Explorer), consumers are no longer impressed. This is a good thing."

    body: "Can you even tell me the name of the person who directed <i>Chicago</i>? Is it a man or a woman? White or black? Those questions are unfortunately easy -- the vast majority of Hollywood directors are white men. So which white man did the deed? What is his name?\n\nYou may know the answer. You may also know that it doesn't really matter; this man -- whose name, incidentally, is Rob Marshall -- will never make a truly great film so as to be remembered alongside Kubrick and Kurosawa, or even alongside Spielberg and Scorsese. He's the guy who didn't screw up. He was a nice boy who made a nice film and Harvey Weinstein has been in everyone's faces for four months saying he should win an Oscar.\n\nMarshall took (or was taken on) the first step to actually getting that Oscar when he accepted the Directors Guild of America (DGA) Award for Best Director yesterday. \n\nThe various guild awards are the best predictors for Oscar winners because they are voted on by the same individuals who will be voting on the Oscars; they're like the dress rehearsal before the main event, and the winner of the DGA Award has almost always gone on to win the Best Director Oscar, and their film almost always wins Best Picture.\n\nTo receive this illustrious honor, Marshall beat out directors Roman Polanski (<i>The Pianist</i>), Martin Scorsese (<i>Gangs of New York</i>), Stephen Daldry (<i>The Hours</i>) and Peter Jackson (<i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i>). All but Jackson are nominated for the directing Oscar, which will be awarded during the Oscarcast on March 23.\n\nThere is still a chance that the apparent favorite for the Oscar, Martin Scorsese, can still win. The DGA award is a very good predictor, but not a perfect one: in 2000, Ang Lee won the DGA award for <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, but Steven Soderbergh won the Oscar for <i>Traffic</i>. Neither film won Best Picture; that honor went to <i>Gladiator</i>.\n\nBack in 1972, even though Francis Ford Coppola won the DGA Award for The Godfather, the Oscar went to Bob Fosse for <i>Cabaret</i>.\n\nWe shall see."

    body: "The Guardian Online is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,906442,00.html?=rss\" target=\"_blank\">running a profile</a> of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the third-in-command of al-Qaida who was arrested in Pakistan this weekend, and will soon be extradited to the U.S. for his apparently very, very major role in planning September 11.\n\nThe story paints Mohammed as a playboy who enjoys womanizing, drinking, scuba diving -- not a religious fanatic like the other al-Qaida principals, but equal to them in his hatred of America and its allies.\n\nThe arrest is expected to be a major blow to al-Qaeda's operations; much of the terrorist cartel's ability to coordinate and execute massively ambitious operations like the 9/11 attacks is attributed to Mohammed's grand vision for blowing up the big stuff, and a talent for that kind of global strategy.\n\nSo sleep a little bit safer now knowing that the U.S. has captured one individual in an executive position, and now thinks that the alleged thousands of al-Qaeda worker bees who actually pull the trigger and set the explosives have just stopped dead in their tracks because their fearless leader is in a Pakistani jail..."

    title: "Bummer: No new Rings trailer for now"

    body: "In <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=14590\" target=\"_blank\">an e-mail to Ain't It Cool News</a>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> producer/director Peter Jackson has shot down growing rumors and anticipation regarding a possible 'to be continued...' preview trailer for <i>The Return of the King</i> (reportedly to be attached to prints of <i>The Two Towers</i> in just two short weeks) as utter balderdash. That's right: balderdash. Deck balderdash.\n\n<blockquote>As far as I'm aware the first ROTK trailer will hit cinemas about May or June.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>We're not doing a ROTK trailer for the end of Two Towers like we did last year. The reason is that the TT extended DVD has been so complex this year, it would have taken too many resources away from trying to get that finished.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The FOTR extended cut had 35 extra CG shots - the TT extended cut has over 150. Weta are plowing through those, plus starting ROTK. We have a huge TT extended cut sound mix in a few weeks. It's all very complex and we deemed an early ROTK trailer as simply too much to take on this time around.</blockquote>\n\nSo in being a killjoy with regard to The Trailer, Jackson has also confirmed that there will be a Platinum Series extended edition DVD of <i>Two Towers</i>, and reading between the lines I would guess that the extended scenes will focus on CG carnage, rather than lovely character bits.\n\nAddendum: <a href=\"http://www.comingsoon.net/\">ComingSoon.net</a> actually broke the (un-)story with confirmation from New Line Cinema yesterday. TheOneRing.net, who posted the rumors that started this whole business, have since <a href=\"http://www.theonering.net/perl/newsview/8/1046283908\" target=\"_blank\">broken the bad news</a> to the geek hordes.\n\n(AICN via...oh, skip it. I done told you already. Deck!)"

      author_name: "&quot;HIV art-school follies&quot; response!!!"
      author_email: "david@practicalmadness.com"
      author_url: ""
      body: "dude, i'm a big fan of david.  i mean, he's a person i totally look up to and stuff.  we're like totally on the same wavelength or astral plane, you know?  anywayz, and i'd just like to say that i totally totally agree with everything he wrote about dan.  cuz david's so smart, yo.  that's why we're friends and shit.  like soulmates.  but, to be fair, i asked dan what he thought too.  anywayz, lemme break it down for ya.\n\n[what david said resides within quotations, and below them are dan's responses.]\n\n\"HIV art-school follies\"\n\n\"One piece was by a young straight man who might have had it, the other was by a probably-younger-than-he-looks gay man who definitely has it. In either case, I've watched two student films about HIV today, and neither one has filled me with a new appreciation for life...\"\n\n(dan's response: i've always wondered why those who have undergone traumatic experiences must shoulder the burden of providing others with a grander appreciation for their lives.  seems a touch unfair, no?)\n\n\"I had problems with Dan's piece which I had some difficulty expressing in a critique where the vocal majority of the class was busy praising said piece as the greatest thing at the Art Institute since the smart classroom.\"\n\n(dan's response: i appreciate the back-handed compliment, but i think you give my piece too much credit.  a few overzealous students aside, i believe the general reaction of the room was rather tepid.)\n\n\"I think I was reacting partly to Dan's critique style, which is to answer every single remark with an acknowledgement that that is something he was going for or is at least interested in, even when the answers are contradictory.\"\n\n(dan's response: oh?  startling observation.  let's read on to find out more, shall we?)\n\n\"For example, in pressing him for some explanation of what the audience is supposed to feel watching it (the class, almost in unison, told me that with a piece as personal as Dan's it should only matter how Dan feels about it), Dan & co. tell me that the audience isn't necessarily supposed to get anything from it...\"\n\n(dan's response: indeed this may be true, but perhaps not in the vindictive manner with which david paints it.  i had no intentions for my video to edify the masses, or break new philosophical ground in humanity's unfailing attempts to better understand ourselves.  i only intended to create a subjective document of an individual experience--which, last i checked, still remains a valid form of artistic expression.)\n\n\"Yet five minutes earlier, he was saying that he wanted to help others who were in his situation. To me that sounds suspiciously like something he wanted an audience to get from the piece.\"\n\n(dan's response: i remember this \"helping others\" issue that david speaks of much differently--perhaps more so because i am the one who actually said it.  i spoke of the guilt that i feel because i presently don't help others in similar situations such as mine was, NOT that i wished my PIECE would serve that purpose.  such pertinent details should not be so callously ignored, david.  tsk-tsk.)\n\n\"Of course it turns out that Dan doesn't have HIV, and the arthritis passed as quickly as it came.\"\n\n(dan's response: david says this as though if i actually did have hiv and continued to suffer from arthritis, such an tragedy would yield a more satisfying video.  or perhaps just a more satisfying reality.)\n\n\"But in the meantime, he's established HIV as a death sentence, and in looking back on his life and pondering death, he's just indirectly said that the people like our next contestant who fight to stay alive with AIDS, even if that struggle is ultimately futile, are just suckers. Well, not really, but HIV being survivable isn't something Dan's film really allows.\"\n\n(dan's response: i find it difficult for me to sit back and allow david's readers to believe that his sudden espousal of the 'hiv-is-not-a-death-sentence' position to be entirely genuine.  i have worked with survivors of hiv.  i'm fully aware that one can live a moderately healthy, happy, and long life with the disease.  perhaps my video does take a fairly existentialist view in that all suffering remains, in the grand scheme of things, somewhat futile, and that a grand overarching moral that one can glean from it does not exist--yet this in no way means that my video propagates a myth about hiv that i myself don't even believe to be true.  and besides, everyone thinks irrationally when the threat of a life-changing illness, specifically aids, presents itself in one's life, no?  it is only this momentary irrationality that i wanted to convey in my video.)\n\n\"I reacted to the navel-gazing of it all -- Dan has nothing to share with us but his pain, and while art-school pambies may find themselves enraptured by his experience, I'd think that even more sophisticated audiences outside of an academic setting would find themselves asking, as I did, where the beef is.\"\n\n(dan's response:  such publicity is more than just wonderful...it's free!  if you, dear reader, would like to see the video and decide for yourselves, please attend my b.f.a. screening.  for details, periodically visit my blog at whoisayiam.blogspot.com.)\n\nremember kids, david rocks!!!  he's a really really bitchin' guy!  he's taught me everything i know, that's for sure.  well, thanks for reading, whomever you are.  even if you are just david."

    body: "Salon Premium is <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/sex/feature/2003/02/26/polite/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">running a story</a> about how the Southern tendency toward denial, indirectness and euphemism -- i.e., anything but just coming out and saying it -- is making the South the United States's fastest-growing hotbed of AIDS infection.\n\n<blockquote>\"This big African-American came into the free clinic where I was conducting studies,\" said Novick. \"And I asked him the standard questions, one of which is 'Are you gay?' His response was so menacing it actually scared me. 'I'm no faggot,' he snapped. 'You calling me a faggot?'! </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"After he calmed down, once I established some trust, I asked him nonchalantly if he had sex with men. 'All the time,' he said. And that's when I knew my whole approach had to change with minorities.\"</blockquote>\n\nPart of the reason for this is attributed to a proportionately much larger African-American population than in the rest of the country; however, the author then goes on to examine how talking frankly about sex and AIDS -- something New Yorkers (for example) have no problem with that is absolutely abhorrent in Dixieland -- can be the first, best line of defense.\n\n(<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salon</a> via <a href=\"/gleaner/\">Gleaner</a>)"

    body: "<a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1035777769334&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154\">This is an outrage</a>: a Canadian woman of Indian descent, while changing planes at O'Hare while traveling from India to Toronto, was tossed head-first into a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare when INS officers decided that her Canadian passport was a fake.\n\nThey threatened to give her the old Indefinite Detainment, but instead chose the slow water torture:\n\n<blockquote>Instead of jailing her on Jan. 27, an INS officer cut the front page of Cruz's passport and filled each page with \"expedited removal\" stamps, rendering it useless. She was photographed, fingerprinted, barred from re-entering the U.S. for five years and immediately \"removed.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Not to Toronto, but to India, where she had just spent several weeks visiting her parents. It took four days, and help from Canadian officials in Dubai and a Kuwaiti Airlines pilot, to get her back home.</blockquote>\n\nI want you to fully appreciate the world we live in now: customs agents, INS officers and TSA security guards are being told on a daily basis that terrorists are lurking around every corner, and that they are the first line of defense.\n\nThey are being told that the slightest suspicion is proof enough to take the most extreme action, all in the name of defending the homeland.\n\nEach of these men and women are just doing their job, trying to be good soldiers so they'll be looked upon favorably at their next performance review, to hopefully get a raise or a promotion.\n\nImagine that these people are working at 7-Eleven. They don't think that the signatures on your ID and your credit card slip match. They refuse to accept the transaction. You cannot have your Big Gulp. You are inconvenienced. You're pissed off. The clerk, however, is just trying to do his job to the best of his ability. It's an admirable ambition. Come on -- can you say that about yourself?\n\nHowever, what if he hadn't just refused to serve you? What if he had seized your credit card and threatened to ruin your credit rating, just because your identification didn't seem 100% legit to a man who's at the end of one too many twelve-hour days?\n\nOur homeland security forces mean well, and ultimately they are protecting us. For that we should applaud them, because they're part of...well, they're part of <i>some</i> kind of solution. But in the unilateralist -- dare I say totalitarian? -- culture creeping through our government right now, we're trusting Very Important Decisions and the futures of many ordinary people to the judgement of a field agent who's spent one too many fourteen-hour days at Orange Alert. \n\nThey are being encouraged to suspect anyone who fits a certain profile -- considering not only national origin, but ethnicity -- of being the Enemy, and are furthermore encouraged to act on these slim suspicions to the extent of their surprisingly considerable power.\n\nThe next international incident will not begin with an assassination or at a summit meeting. It will begin with a federal worker who didn't have time to stop at Starbucks before work."

    body: "<a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/03/02/030216bloggings_ne.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kottke</a> is noting the sense of pride with which many Bloggers are reporting the news that <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> is buying Pyra Labs (of <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger</a> fame). He goes on to compare this with one of the landmark events in Net history, the Netscape IPO:\n\n<blockquote>At the time, Netscape had a ton of good will from its users: it was good, it was free, people loved using it because it gave them access a global network of people and information, the guys responsible for it were just college students...people you might know rather than some faceless corporation. When Netscape went IPO and became worth \$2.6 billion, Netscape users were very proud, like we had all contributed to the company somehow and it had finally paid off.</blockquote>\n\nKottke may not know it, but there is <i>so</i> much wrong with the above statements.\n\n1. Netscape was never free. It had a retail price of \$39.95. If you used the downloaded version longer than 30 days, you were expected to send in a check. NSCP* never enforced this, perhaps because (in their wild-eyed idealism) they thought putting the browser in everyone's hands was more important than collecting a fee for their hard work. This was very noble of them. I'm sure they were thinking about nobility when Microsoft entered their space and crushed them utterly.\n\n2. Yes, the guy(s) who designed Netscape were college students when they built it, and they may yet have been guys that <i>Kottke</i> would have known. However, I never felt like Marc Andreesen was a hero <i>or</i> a regular guy. Netscape was a cool product; it was not, however, a cause or a magic carpet. It was just cool software. I think most Net users thought of it that way -- many of my generation (the ones who came online right before the Great AOL Newbie Holocaust, in 1995-96) and certainly everyone who came after.\n\n3. I'll go out on a limb here and say that Kottke is suffering from the Blogger's unfortunate navel-gazing impulse; specifically, he's saying that because <i>he</i> and his friends felt a personal connection to the success of Netscape -- the first of the irrational dot-com companies to rise, and the first one to fall very, very hard -- <i>everyone</i> did. Is he referring to the insular Blogging community, or to the entire Web? Does he think they are the same thing? Or perhaps that everyone apart from the blognoscenti are irrelevant?\n\nTen years from now, Google will still be around, as will whatever Google product comes of this acquisition. Nobody will remember Pyra, just as most of today's blognoscenti will probably be retired or irrelevant. Netscape is already dead; to compare this deal to their IPO now, so many years later, is like saying how much cooler it was under President Wilson. (Or Kennedy: what is Netscape but the Web's own Camelot myth?)\n\nAt any rate, this deal is about the future, not ancient history.\n\n<i>Now playing: <B>Ride</B> from the album \"Whitechocolatespaceegg\" by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Liz Phair%22\" target=\"_blank\">Liz Phair</a></i>"

    body: "<img src=\"/images/igby.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"igby went down\" width=\"160\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"5\" hspace=\"5\" />This morning Amazon.com's front page has beckoned me to \"experience the greatness of independent film with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007JXWX/demareesworld/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Igby Goes Down</i></a> , the remarkable breakout hit starring Kieran Culkin and Claire Danes.\"\n\nI think I liked this movie better -- I haven't seen it, mind you -- before I knew that Claire Danes plays the girl. Not that I have a problem with Claire Danes, of course. Or Kieran Culkin either: it's not his fault that his brother's predilection for face-slapping supercuteness made a nation hurl for much of the early 90s. But the presence of even a proto-starlet like Danes legitimizes a production that otherwise could have been easily written off as the self-indulgent ramblings of a director with too much money and nothing really to say.\n\nMy apologies to Burr Steers (the director) and all involved; I just have trouble buying a semi-autobiographical story about a disaffected rich kid. I know that <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> was also about a disaffected rich kid, but unlike this Burr Steers guy, Salinger could write.\n\nIncidentally, Claire Danes fans may go to see her playing Meryl Streep's daughter (who is, in the film version, not a militant superdyke) in <i>The Hours</i>. I didn't really like her in that either (and this one I did see), but only because by the time the Parade of Stars That Is That Movie gets around to Danes, the audience suffocates because all the recognizable actors are taking up all the oxygen. Her performance is impeccable, her chin nice and pointy. Just that by the time the roster gets all the way down to 'Danes, Claire, The Daughter', we just want to get back to England to see if Nicole Kidman's nose is going to fall off.\n\nThat said, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007JXWX/demareesworld/\" target=\"_blank\">please click on the link so that I can make money. Thank you. That is all.</a>"

    body: "Salon is running an essay called <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/04/phone_center/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Outsourcing rejection</a>, by and about a woman who got a job as a phone recruiter for a company that does that sort of thing for other companies. My favorite part was when she started interviewing middle managers who thought she was the receptionist. Heh heh heh.\n\nI had a very similar position with a company that provided the technical support for Verizon's DSL service. I wrote a very long, poignant essay on the subject which I will probably put on this website at some point. The key things to know about it are:\n\n1. We are paid to lie to you.\n2. I *am* the supervisor, bitch.\n3. I do hope somebody finally shot Mrs. K.\n\nAh, Mrs. K. (Name changed to protect the guilty.) Ever hear of 'frequent flyers' who keep going to emergency rooms, convinced they have the latest deadly disease and must be pumped full of drugs, stat? Mrs. K was our frequent flyer. On my last day with the company she called; I checked her service history and found over 200 calls in a six-month period, mostly for issues outside of our service boundaries, but that she was convinced were our fault.\n\nYou see, Mrs. K no speak very much Englee. But she want you fix it immedilly!\n\n\"Ma'am, I can't fix it. I am not qualified. You will have to call Microsoft.\"\n\nNo call Microsoff! She want speak you supervisor!\n\n\"Ma'am, I can connect you with my supervisor. Would you like me to do that?\"\n\nNo! I want you fix it immedilly!\n\nAnd the conversation would continue thus for about fifteen minutes before I would hand her to the supervisor, who would talk to her for half an hour and then hang up."

    body: "News outlets are reporting that the shuttle <i>Columbia</i> lost contact with NASA controllers and is now believed to have broken apart on its final descent. There were seven astronauts aboard, including one Israeli fighter pilot serving as a payload specialist.\n\nThere has been no formal announcement that the crew is dead; however, flags are flying at half mast at NASA's Johnson Space Center and at the White House, and there are apocryphal reports of torsos and arms falling from the sky over Houston.\n\n\"We're greatly concerned,'' a NASA spokesman, John Ira Petty, said in an interview on CBS.\n\nThis was the 28th flight of the <i>Columbia</i>, NASA's oldest shuttle, over the 22 years of the shuttle program. (The remaining two, <i>Discovery</i> and <i>Endeavour</i>, were launched after the 1987 <i>Challenger</i> disaster.)

    description: "Here lies HTML. Let's go grave-digging."
    body: "Over at <a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boxes and Arrows</a> there is <a href=\"http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/htmls_time_is_over_lets_move_on.php\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> wearily proclaiming the death of HTML as an overextended, misapplied language, at least with regard to application design. I would have excerpted this article, except that the designers at B&A have found a clever way to make the text on their pages unselectable. At any rate, you have a link.\n\nIt seems to me that people who work the web full time, those who have to deal with the <a href=\"http://www.w3c.org/\" target=\"_blank\">W3C</a>'s apparent belief that what we've been working on all these years (i.e., HTML) is a load of crap, have been drinking the Kool-Aid and are now converted into a bunch of self-hating information theorists and usability snobs obsessed with things like 'validation', 'accessibility' and the 'Semantic Web'.\n\nIf you want to know who these poor souls are, just read some blogs. I got the link to this article from <a href=\"http://www.megnut.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hourihan</a>.\n\nI know that these code-noscenti are supposed to be looking out for our future -- like benevolent geek gods, they are -- and they are frustrated because the future seems to be confusing, directionless, impossible to design for. This is because the people writing the new standards are, by turns, overambitious, overzealous, out of touch and fucking morons. Like, from what I have read, I can see the value in the Semantic Web; I just wish implementing it didn't (apparently) require a total re-do of the HTML language into something non-human-readable.\n\nB&A's article expresses frustration with having to design for myriad browsers on multiple platforms. Everyone has this problem. Jenny's page was just redesigned and it looks totally different on my computer than it does on hers; after I investigated, I found that the biggest difference was that her monitor brightness was turned a little bit too low in order to make the contrast work right. On my LCD screen, with perfect contrast, the colors were totally wrong.\n\n\n\nMy own approach, as little more than an extremely informed hobbyist, to cross-platform ambiguity: work with simple HTML (in accordance with the 4.0 spec) and CSS as much as possible. I use no JavaScript; I find that to use JavaScript (and its demon spawn, DHTML) is just asking for compatibility glitches and browser crashes. Instead, I use PHP for any interactivity. I take a speed hit, but gain reliability.\n\nThat's the trick, really: you have to make a trade-off to get anything out of a website. You can be totally compatible, but that requires working in such simple HTML that your site looks like it was designed by a boring five-year-old. Or you can stick to the latest plain HTML spec, use CSS sparingly, and understand that every new gimmick you add to the mix reduces your compatibility base by a tiny amount.\n\nThere is always a certain amount of ambiguity to webwork; it's unfortunate, but in the end it's actually kinda fun for everyone except the person who has to explain to their bosses why you're not that concerned that potential customers using Opera on Linux can't use the site.\n\nI think that these HTML doomsayers are protesting too much. The W3C is proposing XML-based HTML specs that will potentially change everything, but as I was saying to a co-worker last night (talking about spoken languages, not computers), there's such a thing as high and low forms of a language. With most computer dialects this would not be possible, but HTML -- as just a markup language with myriad different interpretational bugs -- is a rare exception.\n\nGo ahead, rebel against your 'high HTML', aka XHTML and the Semantic Web.\nThose of us below the fray will carry on, speaking our low tongue (HTML 4.0) and living happily as clams."

    body: "Ftrain's Paul Ford <a href=\"http://ftrain.com/ullman_machine.html\" target=\"_blank\">writes about</a> the life of programmer Ellen Ullman (as told in her 1997 book <i>Close to the Machine</i>):\n\n<blockquote>Ullman's prose is lucid, and her narrative of romancing a cypherpunk, coding big applications, and trying to resolve her feelings concerning her father's death, are described with a sort in a tone that oscillates between involvement and detachment, between the real and virtual that anyone who uses computers seriously will find resonant. Much of Ullman's life, we find, happens in gray areas: she is partial, sexually, to women and men alike; she does not go to an office, but puts together teams, and when a project ends, she loses track of her employees. She does not feel she fits in when she meets the polished vice-presidents of banking firms...their daily paths oiled by wealth.\n\nUllman is an outsider, not a resentful one, but a 46-year-old woman...aware that, while she is brilliant, funny, and attractive, her passions, her excitements, keep her out of the mainstream.\n\nFor her, the logical space of the computer is not an alternative or a refuge, exactly, but a place where she does not have to explain herself, where external standards and judgements are irrelevant. The world is ambiguous, but the world inside a computer is neutral , pliable, full of wonders. With one mind, she explores them both. </blockquote>\n\nFord goes on to mention another book, <i>The Bug</i>, about one programmer's quest to eliminate one last bug from a piece of software and the larger adrenaline rush that comes from coding:\n\n<blockquote>I soon found I was using code to avoid writing - oh, I'll just fiddle with this little section here - and a whole day would go by without my having written a scene or a line of dialogue. So I had to put the code aside. </blockquote>\n\nThe comments about Ullman remind me of myself (of course...well, except for the part about being a 46-year-old woman), but even more of my friend Ally who was one of my school's biggest computer fiends, as well as one of its most troubled. For many of us who ever work with these machines, we find they provide something to organize our lives and thoughts -- they're like our sport or our art. (This can be especially frustrating for those of us with artistic leanings outside of the digital domain, but the advent of DV has happily solved this problem for me.)\n\nAlly never embraced ambiguity as much as she might have. In high school she liked women; nowadays she's back with men -- either way, she works under the notion that it must be one or the other, straight or lesbian, and never the possibility of neither or both. She was probably the most Christian agnostic I ever met.\n\nComputers did little to help her; she was aware of programming, but had more of a literary mindset, although even in that realm she could be maddeningly analytical. Her brain was a computer program; unfortunately, she was hoping it would be UNIX when it was actually Photoshop.\n\nHer life confirms my suspicion that it isn't a very good thing to be born brilliant in Alabama."

    body: "Wired is running this brief piece that raises a couple of good points and generally puts it all into perspective. Puts what into perspective? I'm glad you asked: AOL Time Warner (motto: \"If you enjoy it, we probably own it\") yesterday <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/business/30AOL.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> a net loss of almost \$100 billion for fiscal 2001, as well as the resignation of vice chairman Ted Turner. (NY Times; free registration required.)\n\nPoor Ted Turner. (Well, not <i>poor</i> poor -- you know what I mean.) He built a media empire from scratch, and there were rumors that Time Warner's management tried to oust him when TW and Turner merged back in 1998.\n\nBut he held on, even sticking with the company through its ludicrous merger with AOL and the general crappification of AOL-TW's products and such insane management decisions as <i>switching the entire corporation's e-mail</i> to good old AOL. (If this doesn't seem like a blunder worthy of note, just think: <i>this</i> is what AOL TW's management was worrying about when they should have been focused on making, you know, money?)\n\nIt must make Turner cry to watch what Steve Case and company have done to CNN. Well, not <i>cry</i> cry, but you know what I mean.\n\nIt occurs to me to wonder what this might do to some AOL-owned movies still in development, like <i>The Return of the King</i> and <i>Matrix 2 and 3</i>. Probably not, because those budgets were probably set in stone a year ago. But those in the boardroom are probably rooting for New Line and Joel Silver a lot more this morning than they were yesterday.\n\nAlso on the horizon: some analysts and shareholders are calling for a more complete denial of this AOL debacle by <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,57197,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">returning to TW's original name and ticker symbol</a> (Wired News), crafting the illusion that TW swallowed AOL and not the other way around."

AG is long gone, thanks to the RIAA, but Gator is still lurking on my machine, loading on startup, and usually requires a visit to Windows 2K's Process Manager to get rid of it.\n\nIt's an app designed for a single purpose: when you are using IE on Windows, it makes sure you get a lot of pop-ups.\n\nEven running the same browser on the same system, killing Gator's air supply took me from dozens of pop-ups to few or none, depending on the site. Then I found an even better way to avoid those foul things: dump IE for Mozilla altogether.\n\nI never had a sneakware problem as severe as this Xupiter toolbar seems to be, but that's why I'm a Mac user now -- as Cyclops said in the X-Men movie (edited to be relevant): \"If they have anything that can [infiltrate] our [browser], they deserve to catch us.\""

I'm hoping that this new version tops out at maybe a third.\n\nAt any rate, there will be 8-10 works on the disk, plus snazzy motion menus and other wizardry.

    body: "In November 2000, I was asked to come along as a friend and two of his classmates drove down to the waterfront at 31st Street and Lakeshore, set some stuff -- including remaindered books and old vinyl -- on fire, so that we could film the flames.\n\nMy video diary of that event (I prefer that terminology so much to 'home video') remains my strongest work as a student filmmaker -- my most topical piece with my richest imagery and best stuff happening. In fits and starts for the past two and a half years I have been trying to perfect the editing of that film, which I alternately call <i>On Fire</i> (its actual, finished title, on weeks when I feel good about it) or the Fire Project (the working title, for weeks when I don't).\n\n<i>Fire</i> tends to be the video I use to teach myself a new editing system. The roughcut I screened in my very first DV class shortly after the shooting was how I learned Final Cut Pro -- then in a very, very incomplete version 1.0.\n\nLast school term I resumed work on it, again to teach myself a new video system -- in this case, Media 100xe. And the cut became so much closer to what I wanted it to be, and the work continues now that I'm taking an editing aesthetics class -- my hope is to finally finish it, having found the perfect version.\n\nLast night I imported the Media100 cut and some clips from my source tape to begin work on that final cut into (natch) Final Cut Express, and for the first time I have stills from the project:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/On-Fire.jpg\" alt=\"on fire\" border=\"0\" /></div>\n\nI plan to post more information and photos from <i>Fire</i> as I continue work on it, as well as on all my other silly little movies. I may even make a web trailer, which I'm sure will come as thrilling news to my hosting company.\n\n\"Actual bandwidth! The horror!\""

    body: "At my school there is a girl I like to look at.\n\nJust that -- just looking -- and not in a sexual way or because I'm in love with her, think she'd be intriguing, no. She's an aspiring interior architect, for chrissakes. She's not grotesque; in fact, she's beautiful. Beyond beautiful, with long, slender everything (yet she still has breasts), smooth alabaster skin and impossibly high cheekbones.\n\nShe is, in fact, too beautiful to be alive. Her body is not sexy or desirable so much as it is reminiscent of the 'aliens' from the last 20 minutes of <i>A.I.</i>: like someone had proofread and corrected the human form until the result is aesthetically perfect, but so much so that it just doesn't feel right.\n\nHers is a body none should possess, not even herself. She is not human, and I look because I can't believe she actually manages to walk down Michigan Avenue without being blown into the side of a nearby building and snapped into pieces like a twig, or shattered like glass.\n\nI cannot imagine lusting after her; I can't imagine sleeping with her, or how that would even work with her tiny toothpick frame. It isn't love; I know this because when I look at her -- these are stolen glances, of course; it would be rude to stare -- I don't feel at all self-conscious, because I don't care at all whether she's looking back.\n\nBut if I could look long at her without fear of seeming an asshole, I could imagine myself whispering notes into a tape recorder: \"Hmm, I wonder what it <i>eats</i>...\"\n\nThis girl is like a fine handbag -- think Prada, think Kate Spade on her best day -- or the latest, tiniest cellphone. She looks expensive and impractical, and she has to hide her arms in long sweaters or else not even she could imagine actually doing anything with them."

    body: "Bowing to pressure from female friends, <i>Inluminent/weblog</i> has added a feature which hides the scantily clad ladies from view. This feature is turned on by default, but can be deactivated -- revealing the cheesecake -- with one mouse-click, and thanks to a cookie, your misogyny preference is persistent between visits to the site.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"/images/inluminent_example.gif\" alt=\"Example\"></div>\n\nThe image on the right shows Inluminent with girl pics turned off (the default setting); on the right you see the blog in its natural, hormone-addled state. The title of the blog entry on both screenshots is \"One More Attack on the Mac Web for an RSS Feed\".\n\nIncidentally, one of Inluminent's arguments in said entry is that a site can in some way increase their revenue by offering sponsored RSS feeds. This is a little bit like saying Starbucks could make more money by selling advertising on the side of the Mocha Sanani bags -- and only the Sanani. Sanani, incidentally, is our highest-priced coffee. We don't sell very much of it.\n\nThe connection is this: very few web users even know what RSS is, just as relatively few coffee drinkers have even heard of Mocha Sanani. It is the job of the visionary to say what <i>might</i> happen; it is the job of the businessman to observe what <i>is</i> happening, and sell it. The vast majority of MacUpdate visitors will be referred by a link or a search engine. They will not be coming from a targeted RSS feed -- that would be as if Starbucks did all their marketing to people who had just drank ten cups of coffee, exclusively.\n\nAlso, RSS readers tend to be extremely picky about their information: adding 'Related user reviews' links would be superfluous because nobody would use them, as RSSers prefer to more precisely control what information they're seeing.\n\nI will give him credit for this much: it's one thing to remove the ladies, but to provide the <i>option</i> to remove the ladies makes for a good, usable website that's responsive to its visitors' needs, at least as regards softcore porn.\n\nNow let's see him explain that header graphic."

    title: "Oscars Watch: Directors' Guild nominees announced"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Okay, class: pencils down, predicting caps on, shot glasses at the ready."
    body: "As it's become clear that nobody's going to play my little Oscar Nominees guessing game, I don't imagine that it'll hurt anything if I tell you that Polanski (<i>The Pianist</i>), Scorsese (<i>Gangs of New York</i>), Stephen Daldry (<i>The Hours</i>), Peter Jackson (<i>The Two Towers</i>) and Rob Marshall (<i>Chicago</i>) have all been nominated for the Directors Guild of America awards, which will be awarded on March 1.\n\nThe guild awards are the best predictor of who is going to win the Oscar, as they are nominated and voted upon by more or less the same group of people who vote on the Oscars.\n\nThe Golden Globes are run by the Hollywood Foreign Press, most other major awards are selected by critics and other know-it-alls -- in any case, people with little or no connection to the industry. The Oscars, on the other hand, are considered more authoritative because they are by the American film industry, for the industry, like the guild awards. How authoritative they may be for you as an individual depends on how much you like Ron Howard movies.\n\nAt the risk of giving all you Oscars Game players (yeah, all none of you) a leg up, my prediction (assuming that at least four of these five are nominated for Best Director at the Oscars, as is often the case) is that everyone but Scorsese and Polanski will be effectively out of the game.\n\nScorsese might win because he's one of the great American filmmakers who has been embarrassingly overlooked in the past. I mean, the Oscar that was rightly Scorsese's for <i>GoodFellas</i> went to Kevin Costner, for chrissakes. In fact, I'd say Scorsese is the most likely pick, even though <i>Gangs of New York</i> is considered to be far from the man's best work.\n\nHowever, Roman Polanski may slip in under the Holocaust rule: not only is his film a very highly-regarded, well-reviewed <i>true</i> story about the Holocaust, but Polanski is himself a Holocaust survivor and, like Scorsese, one of those great directors who came to prominence in the 70s who as yet has not won an Oscar.\n\nThe winner of the DGA Award almost always wins the Oscar for Directing. However there have been more exceptions to this rule in the past ten years than in the fifty years before that, so we'll have to wait and see."

But that all changed when I decided (while removing a ton of my garbage and personal effects from the corner of the room reserved for kitties Sophie and Bess and their litter box) to futz with the valve on our radiator. About fifteen minutes later, a creepy gurgling sound started to emit from the valve, and much to my surprise, the radiator was warm to the touch for the first time since we moved in.\n\nMy first thought, of course, was to remove the four or five cardboard boxes I had stacked on top of it."

    body: "This morning's Wall Street Journal reports that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1043013622300562504,00.html?mod=home%5Fpage%5Fone%5Fus\" target=\"_blank\">the X-Men are not human</a>, according to a U.S. judge ruling in a dispute between Marvel Comics and the U.S. Customs Service.\n\nJudge Judith Barzilay found the X-Men and their fellow Marvel characters to be 'nonhuman creatures', and the action figures in their image were thereby subject to a lower import duty during the mid-1990s. The comic book giant is seeking massive refunds of prior tariffs that were levied under the assumption that the human-seeming figures, were 'dolls' and not 'toys'.\n\n<blockquote>Judge Barzilay...described in her ruling how she subjected many of the figures to \"comprehensive examinations.\" At times that included \"the need to remove the clothes of the figure.\"\n\nThe X-Men, oddly, gave her the least trouble. They are mutants, she declared, who \"use their extraordinary and unnatural powers...on the side of good or evil.\" The judge observed how the character Storm, with her flowing white hair and dark skin, \"can summon storms at will,\" while Pyro has a \"mutant ability to control and shape flames.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe Journal quotes current <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> writer Chuck Austen and fansite owner Brian Wilkinson in protest of the decision, both arguing that superheroes are (in Wilkinson's words) \"supposed to be as normal as you or I. They live in New York. They have families and go to work. And now they're no longer human?\"\n\nWell, sir, you <i>did</i> say they live in New York.\n\n(Paid subscription required; free trial available.

So after an intense visit to Radio Shack, where the clerk called me beautifully insane and an A/V rogue of the highest order , I linked my walkman (I&#8217;m using that brand name generically, Sony&#8212;suck it!) to my computer and was able to turn cheap tape to laserfied digital sheen.</blockquote>\n\nThis is more proof that an English degree should be, in some hands, considered a deadly weapon. Whose hands, exactly? Well, we could just go around asking people if they've ever addressed Sony in a parenthetical regarding a long-dead trademark dispute..."

    extended: "Copyright law, of course, prevents anyone from using owned creative work without express permission from the creator, which is usually granted only in return for steep royalties. In the case of corporate-owned works -- such as \"Casablanca\", which was due to enter the public domain within the next two years had this challenge succeeded -- such permission is usually never granted at any price.\n\nThere is, of course, the 'fair use' provision, which allows the free use of creative works without permission of the author for purposes of commentary or criticism, but this provision has been under fire recently as media conglomerates seek to assert more control over what <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\" target=\"_new\">Cory Doctorow</a> characterizes as \"our shared cultural heritage\"."

    body: "Via <a href=\"/gleaner/\">Gleaner</a>: Salon's Charles Taylor <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2003/01/13/bart/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">takes Daily Variety editor-in-chief Peter Bart to task</a> for printing a lengthy, \"remarkably misinformed\" screed attacking movie critics for having their own opinions, rather than simply reinforcing the often questionable taste of consum-- uh, moviegoers:\n\n\"Bart suggests that critics prove their unreliability by offering different opinions on which movie is the best of the year. It doesn't occur to him that a moviegoer might see that diversity of opinion as offering an array of movies to check out.\""
    extended: "Among the tidbits Taylor points out: Bart thinks the Madonna vehicle <i>Swept Away</i> was one of the best films of the year; that he considers both <i>Morvern Callar</i> (a worldwide festival hit that is only just opening in some cities) and its star Samantha Morton (you may remember her from <i>Minority Report</i>) to be \"obscure\", and the critics who include the film on their top ten lists are simply elitist dogs; that in discussing the role of critics in American moviegoing, he considers the opinions of studio ad executives to be more expert than the critics themselves.\n\nThere's lots more; I haven't nearly given away the whole article. <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2003/01/13/bart/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to read it if you haven't already.\n\nIt does seem that movie critics' tastes are sometimes divorced from the mainstream, and when you consider that the best mainstream critic -- Chicago's own Roger Ebert -- usually can't even get simple facts straight in his head, reading movie criticism can sometimes seem pointless.\n\nAnd if you live in Dismal Seepage, MS, reading a list that includes <i>City of God</i> (which won't be released in the US until much later this year), <i>Spirited Away</i> or <i>Morvern Callar</i> can make you feel like \"the cinema\" (as embodied by <i>The Pianist</i>) and \"the movies\" (as embodied by <i>Chicago</i>) are two very different things.\n\nI would offer this theory: critics (even Bart's \"elitists\" at the New York Times) see, and often have to write about, every single film that is released. That means that for every <i>The Hours</i> there are ten <i>Just Married</i>s and twenty <i>Spider-Man</i>s. And rather than simply pick the highest-grossing films or the ones that readers would choose in a poll, these critics gravitate towards films which still believe in movies as an art form, rather than a business.\n\nFor my own part, I could care so much less that they've made <i>Terminator 3</i>, and I find the concept of a <i>Pirates of the Carribbean</i> movie to be wrong on so many levels. And yet I'm dying to see the <i>Matrix</i> sequels and <i>The Return of the King</i>, because there is something else working there. However, my interest in studio movies ends there: the movies I'm most interested in seeing right now, this minute, are of the \"elitist\" sort. Specifically, \"25th Hour\", \"Adaptation\" and \"Morvern Callar\"."

    body: "I still haven't seen the final episode of <i>Survivor: Thailand</i> - the one where that schmuck Brian won the game - and I think three Weeks without the show (or cable TV in general) have been good for me. The proof: CBS has released the names and headshots of the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/20/earlyshow/series/survivor/main533850.shtml\" target=\"_new\">sixteen <i>Survivor: The Amazon</i> castaways</a>, and I could give a rat's ass.\n\nHowever, I do recognize that there are stillpeople with the desire (and \$47/mo) to carry on, so I may as well introduce them to you. I should point out that I really don't think I'll be following the series (...much), so I'm going to take whatever information I have and construct one of my patented Practical Psychic Visions (!) for how each player will do in the game.\n\nHere goes...\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/alex_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_1_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">ALEX BELL</a>, a 30-something-looking white dude from somewhere they wear black sweaters and green shell-thingy necklaces, will show a nasty, manipulative side while on a water run. However, nobody will be there to see it, and Alex will not appreciate it when his tribemates fail to cower in abject fear of his evil. So he'll probably just sit quietly -- perhaps gently rocking back and forth -- and wait for the token black dude to sit down for five seconds, then whisper to whoever is sitting closest to him, \"dude, [Cedric or whatever his name is] sure is lazy.\" Unfortunately, when it turns out there are no token black men in the cast, Alex will realize only too late that he probably should have told someone apart from that gentleman holding the rifle.\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/daniel_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_2_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">DANIEL LUE</a>, a twenty-something who is way too happy about wearing a gray wifebeater, is the token Asian-American cast member, who will display some disgusting personal habit as well as an unfortunate predilection for tangrams. When it is revealed that this season's challenges are, alas, tangram-free, Daniel will be screwed and forced into an alliance with the most loathed member of the cast, whoever that is.&nbsp;\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/dave_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_3_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">DAVE JOHNSON</a>, a twenty-something who really should have read the above comments about shell-thingy necklaces, will suffer the fate of such castaways as Rob, Robb and Dr. Sean. On the plus side, every village needs an idiot, and I hear there's a secret stash of Doritos(tm) somewhere off in that dark, dangerous-sounding piece of jungle <i>riiiight there</i>...&nbsp;\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/deena_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_4_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">DEENA BENNETT</a> has approximately 47 freckles on her left bicep, which means that she will be the first Survivor to use a word with the letter 'R' in it. She will also be the first Survivor whose name will be misspelled at an Amazonian Tribal Council by a tribemate whose college education (major: spellingology) implies an actual, y'know, education.&nbsp;\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/joanna_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_5_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">JOANNA WARD</a>, a twenty-something African-American woman, thinks that she will win the game because Vecepia has cleared the way for all African-American women to win a million dollars for being as dull as a doorstop on a popular national television series. Sadly, she will forget to re-watch her taped copy of the first season, in which the token black woman was taken ill and eaten alive by her tribemates. &nbsp;\n\n<img src=\"/images/survivor6/matthew_sm.jpg\" align=\"left\" height=\"75\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/01/10/earlyshow/photoessay536119_0_6_photo.shtml\" target=\"_new\">MATTHEW VON ERTFELDA</a>?

    title: "Chicago to Vienna: \$15"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Simply put, Julius Meinl Chicago is as comfy as a Caribou, as delectable as Peet's and more elegant than Starbucks could ever hope to be."
    body: "<i>Quoth Jenny, with regard to Starbucks: \"By 'community coffeehouse', we mean 'corral'.\"</i>\n\nWhatever possessed someone from Vienna's venerable <a href=\"http://www.meinl.com/\" target=\"_new\">Julius Meinl</a> coffee chain to open their first and only American shop in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood, I'm glad it happened, because nothing in American coffee -- not Peet's, certainly not Starbucks or Caribou -- can compare to the experience of a true, proper <i>kaffehaus</i>.\n\nThanks to my wonderful employers, here's what we expect of coffee shops in America: you stand in line, look up at a McDonalds-style menu, order and pay upwards of \$2.50 for some concoction of battery-acid espresso and lukewarm steamed milk. You get your drink in a paper cup and split before the crowd of people behind you can swarm in for their own drinks.\n\nThis, my friends, is why, when Starbucks announced plans to open stores in Vienna, there were protests and even attempts to burn the first store down before they were finished building it.\n\nMoments into a visit to Meinl's in Chicago, one can understand why. The Viennese take their coffee seriously not only as a beverage, but as a culinary and cultural experience. Coffeehouses are where the Viennese have always gathered to smoke, enjoy a good coffee and argue the meaning of existence.\n\nAnd they do so in perhaps the most refined, sophisticated spaces imaginable. Meinl's has managed to manufacture such a space here in Chicago; a theorist could argue that in manufacturing something that is <i>like</i> a Viennese coffeehouse, and not spontaneously, intrinsically a Viennese coffeehouse, Julius Meinl Chicago exists semiotically somewhere just this side of Disney World. Such a theorist can kiss my shiny, metal butt.\n\nMeinl's is simply a great place to hang, and do they ever encourage hanging. Perhaps it's because we were there on a weeknight when there was nothing compelling enough playing at the nearby Music Box Theater to draw a bigger crowd, but the space just reeks of intimacy and calm. Several Wrigleyville denizens were in there with laptops and Wi-Fi cards (I don't know if Meinl's is rigged for Wi-Fi but it wouldn't surprise me); it seems like the nicest place imaginable to write a novel. (Maybe J.K. Rowling should come to Chicago to finish that damned Harry Potter book...)\n\nI ordered Meinl's Millennium Torte, a luscious chocolate torte served with a drizzle of raspberry coulis and vanilla custard cream. Jenny had an Opera Torte, with layers of hazelnut, espresso and burnt sugar, with caramel sauce on the side. Both of us ordered espressos (hers a single, mine a double), which was served in the traditional Viennese manner: in china cups, on silver trays, with a tiny demi pitcher of cream, a glass of water and a piece of rich chocolate on the side.\n\nAltogether the bill came to a little under \$15, which is more than one would expect to spend at Starbucks (Meinl's pastries range from \$4-7; Starbucks's are \$1.25-\$2.50) but you truly do get what you pay for, and then some. Like Starbucks, Meinl's has a wide selection of retail swag, all imported from Vienna -- straight from Vienna. All the labels are in German, and the prices are far from what you'd pay for comparable stuff at, say, Whole Foods. In America, these things are premium; in Europe, they're simply expected.\n\nThe seating is open, and there is table service, which was polite and as swift as could be expected from the cafe's one, lone waiter. In fact, even their to-go coffees are kind of expected to be consumed in-store, at the little standing tables nearest the door. We chose a small table in the very back; nearly all the seats are of the big and comfy variety, and I sprawled out on a small sofa. The lighting is suitably subdued, and the clientele not terribly annoying in their yuppiness.\n\nWhat I liked most was the general lack of pretension; the staff are extremely respectful of the environment they're trying to cultivate, and treat guests as such. This is a far cry from my beloved employers, who send people out into their cafes only for cleaning and to sample things in order to generate more sales. Meinl's is a very low-pressure environment, and the laid-back quality is what made our visit there so soothing. Simply put, the place is as comfy as a Caribou, as delectable as Peet's and more elegant than Starbucks could ever hope to be."

    description: "It's three o'clock -- do you know where your orcs are?"
    body: "For what it's worth, I was a little disappointed by<i> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i>, although it's the sort of disappointment created by heightened expectations. I wouldn't say that <i>Two Towers</i> failed to live up to my expectations -- it's an incredible movie that filmically tops even its predecessor. Rather, I was expecting something a little more like <i>Fellowship</i> and got something a little more like <i>Braveheart</i>.\n\nWhereas the first movie spent plenty of time with the characters, especially the hobbits, this new chapter is almost non-stop action. \"It's minute 10 -- do you know where your orcs are?\" Piled on the ground, probably, as this movie goes through orcs faster than George Lucas goes through smoothies.\n\nThe only thing speedier than an orc-slaying here is the introduction of major new characters, as in the same time it took <i>Fellowship</i> to show us just the hobbits, Gandalf, Saruman and the Black Riders, we are introduced to the entire kingdom of Rohan, its enfeebled king Theoden (Bernard Hill, best known for playing the captain in Titanic), his shieldmaiden* niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and loyal nephew Eomer (Karl Urban), the foul Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), Cute Rohan Refugees #1 and #2 (played by Peter Jackson's kids...ain't they cute?), Riff Raff (Richard O'Brien, or at the very least, his orcish cousin)...and I think Jackson even manages to squeeze in the introduction of the Ents, the long-awaited debut of Gollum (Andy Serkis), the Black Gate of Mordor and the resurrection of Gandalf, all within that same half hour or so.\n\nSo when reviews say that <i>The Two Towers</i> expands the world created in <i>Fellowship</i>, they mean it. Early and often.\n\n<i>The Two Towers</i> is the most worked-on, storywise, of the three films; whereas <i>Fellowship</i> was an extremely faithful adaptation of Tolkien's novel, <i>Two Towers</i> makes major departures, usually to better and more interesting places than anything Tolkien ever thought up**. It's proven to be Jackson's approach to off-load a lot of the major plot developments of Book Two (the discovery of Saruman's <i>palantir</i>, that whole business about the giant spider) onto the other movies, which is good, because after seeing <i>Orcstravaganza! III: That's Evisceration!</i>, followed by The Biggest Battle In Cinema History, followed by the winged Nazgul, followed by Gollum playing his own ventriloquist's dummy, a giant spider just might seem like overkill.\n\n** Except for Evil Faramir."

    description: "I guess the burqa modeling competition wasn't enough of an olive branch, guys. Also: Homeland security, a la HP Compaq."
    body: "The BBC reports that over <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2501893.stm\" target=\"_new\">100 people are dead in Nigeria</a> following riots over the Miss World beauty pageant, which is being held in the city of Kaduna, because you know, when I think of a country that likes a good beauty pageant, I just think...you know? Nigeria!\n\n<blockquote>[The riots] began after a newspaper suggested that the Prophet Mohammed would have probably chosen to marry one of the Miss World contestants if he had witnessed the beauty pageant.</blockquote>\n\nThe report goes on to say that Kaduna is one of Nigeria's most volatile cities, which sounds something like saying any given building is one of the more dangerous parts of Cabrini-Green.\n\nMore than 2,000 people died there two years ago in clashes between Christians and Muslims; Thursday's riots involved thousands of Muslim youths who feel \"the contest is immoral and degrading to women\".\n\nI guess the burqa modeling competition wasn't enough of an olive branch, guys.\n\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"75%\" noshade=\"noshade\" />\n\nSalon has a couple of gems this morning: first, Ashish Nanda, a mergers expert and professor at the Harvard Business School, is arguing that the creation of the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will, like most big corporate mergers, fail to be a panacea in solving the problem at hand, in this case fighting the War On Terrorism&trade;.\n\nSays Nanda:\n\n<blockquote>When you talk about the challenge of merger integration, whether you look at it from the point of view of the possibility of success or of how long it takes, these are challenging, difficult things. It's going to be...even more challenging for the Department of Homeland Security [because] that in all the mergers I'm talking about there are only two organizations, and here there are 20-plus. </blockquote>\n\nHomeland Security director Tom Ridge has reportedly spoken to executives at Hewlett-Packard and Lockheed Martin -- two firms that have recently been involved in huge mergers -- for advice on how to smooth the Homeland Security integration.\n\nDHS will encompass 22 new and existing government agencies and will employ over 170,000 federal workers, ostensibly to improve interagency cooperation in order to do away with the hostile, competitive atmosphere which (it is believed) led to the intelligence failure on 9/11.\n\nHowever, the two agencies (arguably) most responsible for gathering and acting on that intelligence, the FBI and CIA, will remain where they are.\n\nThe agencies to be folded into DHS include the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Coast Guard and the Secret Service, as well as the Transportation Security Authority (TSA), a new agency created to oversee (among other things, but mostly) airport security now that passenger screening is being conducted by federal employees."

    body: "<b>\"I have a career, clients, a girlfriend, priorities. I must find the time to become a squirrel, one that sings.\"</b> - <a href=\"http://ftrain.com/so_tired.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ftrain</a>\n\nI am showing him a flicker film. I am showing archival footage of my family. I am showing him a walking piece. It is clear that he is not impressed.\n\n\"So how's the project?\" asked Frederic, who hasn't seen me, the prodigal student, in two weeks. This is more serious than you might think, as I am taking two of Frederic's classes and have managed to miss two weeks' worth of both of them. If I weren't a senior working on a (presumably) major project, I would have been failed by now.\n\n\"The project,\" I begin, \"is an unmitigated disaster,\" and I then proceed to place the blame on having shot not a single frame of video in four weeks of production time on:\n\n&raquo; My unreliable, goldbricking performers, who \"just keep not showing up\". This is because I am not calling them.\n\n&raquo; My own inexperience/inability to get others involved with and duly excited about my projects. (This much we know is true.)\n\n&raquo; Work. Fully ten minutes of our discussion was spent talking about the general insanity of working even two days a week at a Starbucks on Michigan Avenue during the holiday season, and of course, it's too late to get out of any of it. Unless, of course, (heh heh heh heh heh) I quit.\n\n&raquo; Home. Bills, bills, electrical fires, more bills, the well of misery and despair that I keep, tend and cultivate. It looks suspiciously like a brown swivel chair.\n\n&raquo; A man from mars who eats up cars, bars, guitars, shoots you dead, eats your head, et al.\n\nWhat I did <i>not</i> say was that I'm suffering from fear of failure, and in true Demaree style, I am dealing with this fear by facing it head-on. This is a very admirable plan if one is trying to conquer a fear of (for example) snakes or very large ice cream cones, but it is not always prudent (I trust you'll agree) to deal with a fear of failure by procrastinating, skipping class and standing up the people who can help you.\n\nI am scheduled for another meeting with Frederic on Friday; how we left it was, if I can get anything shot before then -- anything at all -- we will meet and decide how to proceed. If not, we won't, which will pretty much seal my fate.\n\nAll of this would have been so much easier if I had made a movie over the last week in October instead of taking the week off. Now the last eight years of my life just might end up wasted because I don't feel like getting out of bed until 9.\n\nAll this just makes me want to go back to bed."

    title: "Dark Lord's Cut"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Forget your weekend plans."
    body: "We spent most of today in bed, laying about and watching the new-and-improved DVD edition of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, which is now 208 minutes long and still feels a little short.\n\nThe best changes:\n- The extended opening sequence feels much less abrupt and gives more screen time to Ian Holm, which is always a good thing. In fact, the entire first hour or so of the movie has been retooled to be closer to Tolkien's storytelling, rather than the conventional narrative approach of the theatrical cut. (Basically, for the three-hour theatrical version they favored Frodo and Gandalf in the opening because we're going to have to spend three movies with them and only one with Bilbo.)\n\n- Throughout the movie, Frodo's role has been expanded, which is great because it breaks up the pattern of 'oops, this scene's been running for five minutes, time to save Frodo' that the theatrical cut fell into. He is stronger and more of a leader tot he hobbits, and seems like someone who just might be able to pull off this crazy ring-destroying quest.\n\n- More Gollum. And more Gollum. And that's great, because (as we can see in the trailers) Gollum will play a major role in <i>The Two Towers</i> and it's important to establish his presence throughout the trilogy, not just in Part Two. So important, in fact, that it'll be interesting to see how they deal with having left this information out to begin with. Despite all his claims to the contrary, the longer editions of these movies seem to be Jackson's 'official' cuts, and ten years from now what we will be watching and rewatching is the twelve-hour DVD series, rather than the nine-hour theatrical version.\n\n- The entire Lothlorien sequence has been reworked, and again, I can't see how they could have left this stuff out to begin with. The Fellowship's entry into Lothlorien isn't nearly as easy as it was in the movie, and Galadriel's role is much expanded. We see that she is a ring-bearer, and we see her give parting gifts to all of the Fellowship which will become significant as the saga continues.\n\nBasically, this version is the one they should have released originally, as it solves so many little problems without adding too much to the running time. That's not to say that the theatrical version was as flawed as most movies, but how can we go forward into <i>The Two Towers</i> and beyond without knowing (for example) how Sam gets his rope?\n\nThe making-of documentaries, meanwhile, are not only good -- they are <i>long</i>. We haven't even touched Disc Three yet (containing docs about Tolkien and the pre-production and design process); Disc Four alone (covering principal photography through the film's release) runs about three hours, on top of three and a half for the new cut of the feature.\n\nLike the DVD Journal once said about the Criterion <i>Brazil</i> set: \"Forget your weekend plans.\" (That set used to seem like such a big deal. Heh.)"

    description: "We have to wake him thirty minutes before closing time or else he'll be there all night."
    body: "Tonight's (or rather, this morning's) entry into the ongoing saga of OS X -- I have now used the screen saver-as-desktop trick, and agree that it is fabulous. Moving on...\n\n<b>1. Tuesday night the so-called real world intrudes upon my happy domestic bliss with OS X and, of course, Jenny</b> to remind me that sometimes (gasp!) I can get screwed too...\n\n<blockquote><i>GET ON WITH IT!!!</i></blockquote>\n\nOh, of course. So sorry.\nMy wallet was stolen. Well, probably not stolen. Not stolen per se. More likely just fell out of my coat pocket on the #36 bus as it lurched forward and, thanks to the magic of inertia, I did not. Not that any of this hairsplitting made the scene we caused at Cosi's any more palatable, or having to make the four mile roundtrip home to grab a credit card any more fun. Especially since <i>he</i> was there.\n\nEach of us has an archenemy, I suppose. Superman has Lex Luthor. Spider-Man has the Green Goblin (or Venom, for a brief period in the early 90s). If you work in retail/foodservice in the Near North or just happen to take the CTA's #36 bus or Red Line train, you have probably seen Newspaper Man at least once.\n\nHe's the one wearing a brown raincoat or sport jacket, usually with a bright. Red. Hawaiian shirt on underneath. He's the one carrying 6-12 shopping bags full of newspapers everywhere he goes. And when he brings them into Starbucks, he brings them in two by two, two by two, very so methodically. And he does it in <i>stages</i>. He'll carry two to the sign that says \"Line forms here\". He'll carry the others to that point. He'll make several trips. Then he'll start carrying them to the small condiment bar. He'll make several trips. And so on.\n\nFinally, once everything is safely scattered around his chair in the back cafe and he's ordered his obligatory cup of coffee-cum-insurance policy against getting thrown out, he will nestle himself into a big, comfy leather armchair and fall asleep.\n\nWe have to wake him thirty minutes before closing time or else he'll be there all night.\n\n<b>2. This evening (Wednesday) we ate at the Tempo Cafe,</b> a not-so-greasy spoon at Chestnut and State. They're quite an anomaly: a 24-hour diner serving diner food right smack in the middle of one of Chicago's ritziest neighborhoods, where they've been doing things the way they do them for years.\n\nHow do they do them? Well, to begin with, they're cash only. If you order one of their legendary omelets, you will inexplicably recieve a single orange slice and stewed prune with your order. On the entrees, the vegetable <i>could be</i> corn on the cob; then again, it could be a couple of tomato slices. None of this is on the menu. I think the kitchen makes things up as they go along.\n\nBut the food? Quite wonderful indeed. I had chopped sirloin with grilled onions and mashed potatoes. Jenny had the grilled pork chops with, natch, mashed potatoes. We both had cups of some really ripping potato soup, and the bread -- served with sweet, creamy Danish butter -- kicks serious booty. If that weren't a big enough meal (all of this is <i>included</i> when you order an entree), you have your choice of yummy Greek-style rice pudding or, um, Jell-O.\n\nWe opted for the rice pudding.\n\n<b>3. You know? Even though my wallet was stolen (lost) and I'm gonna have to move heaven and earth to get things back under control, I think things are pretty perfect.</b>\n\n<b>4. <i>Scarlet's Walk</i>, the new Tori Amos album, is a mixed success</b> in kind of the same way that <i>Boys for Pele</i> -- her previous attempt at a 'concept' album, and the least popular of her six previous efforts -- was a mixed success. Here Tori has an idea for a theme, and some ideas of how to get there, and her ongoing desire to become someone else for the sake of singing their songs. That said, she is still Tori Amos, and the <i>song</i>, not the album, is her medium. That is to say that while her albums are always very coherent and very good, here she's perhaps tried too hard to make all the music gell together into an Album (note the capital A). But I'm still listening.\n\n<b>5. I read in Macworld some weeks ago</b> about how to set up Mac OS X (which, beneath its candy-coated, idiotproofed UI, is UNIX) with PHP and MySQL for development purposes.

    title: "Creative scheduling"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "If you added 25 plus 20 plus 10 and came up with 30, congratulations, you could be teaching an Advanced Video workshop."
    body: "So my Advanced Video Projects professor decided that it would be nice if we took a field trip to the Experimental Sound Studio, a do-it-yourself sound production house run (in part) by SAIC professor and local sound guru Lou Mallozzi, that caters to the sonic whims of the Windy City's creative avant-garde. Typically this involves using Pro Tools to cut all the 'umm' and 'ya know what I'm sayin?' out of student videos and then adding a line to the credits stating that the \"sound [was] edited entirely using Pro Tools\". This makes them look technically savvier than they are, and may get them a job at a production house, or may just raise the (illusory) technical bar which other videomakers must strive to describe, analyze and whine about.\n\nSo my professor schedules this field trip -- may I add that this class is an advanced projects workshop which, in the normal course of events, is not really even supposed to meet as a group unless absolutely necessary and yet has found a reason to waste up to four hours every Thursday morning since August -- for this morning, Thursday morning, at 11:30 a.m.\n\nSometime between last week's unnecessary meeting and Monday, I get a letter from SAIC informing me that if I intend on participating in the Undergraduate Exhibition next Spring, I had better be at the Betty Rymer Gallery at noon today. I e-mail the instructor and explain that due to this meeting I will be unable to join the others at ESS (too bad, so sad) but I hope everyone has a great time, I know I did when I went with Mallozzi's Sound class last year, <i>hint hint I've already been don't expect me bye see you next week <b>bye</b></i>.\n\nAnd so tonight, I get this message from the instructor, sent to the entire class:\n\n<blockquote>hey all\nthis is an EMERGENCY TIME CHANGE for our ESS visit...\n\n(due to the mandatory senior graduation meeting tomorrow at noon)\n\nWe will now meet up there at 1:30pm, thursday the 24th!</blockquote>\n\nShe goes on to say that she will also be trying to contact everyone by phone to inform them of this important change in schedule.\n\nHere, fellow students, is your critical reasoning problem for today. No need to take notes; however, there will be a quiz later. Okay: Student A is sitting in a meeting at Columbus and Jackson. The meeting starts at noon and is scheduled to last one hour, not counting the Q & A session. Student A is also expected to meet with his class in a tiny hole-in-the-wall sound studio somewhere on the Far North Side at 1:30 p.m.\n\nHe has thirty minutes, at most, to get from Columbus and Jackson to Paulina and Berwyn. He is three blocks away from the nearest L stop that will take him anywhere near his destination, and his destination is a twenty minute walk from the Berwyn L stop. The train ride from Jackson to Berwyn takes at least 25 minutes, not taking any lunch rush into consideration.\n\nSo let's break out the calculators, shall we? That's twenty minutes to walk from the L to the studio, after a 25 min. train ride from the Loop, plus a ten minute walk from the Betty Rymer to the L. Add those numbers together and figure your estimated time of arrival at ESS.\n\nIf you added 25 plus 20 plus 10 and came up with 30, congratulations, you could be teaching an Advanced Video workshop."

    body: "\"Tea and biscuits. How very English of you.\"\n\"One needs a stiff upper lip in the morning, to hold back all the drool.\"\n\nI'm editing this post using <a href=\"http://www.wbloggar.com/\">w.bloggar</a>, a desktop client for <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blogger</a> which happens to be compatible with my <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Movable Type</a>-powered weblog. The advantages of w.bloggar are that it, unlike MT's web-based editor, I can just highlight and click to add links, and I can directly import entries from text files and whatnot.\n\nHowever, it <i>is</i> designed for Blogger, not Movable Type. However, while you don't title your posts in Blogger, you do in MT, and so it could be very awkward figuring out how to use w.bloggar to initiate a post. However, this post I began a week or so ago from within MT, and editing it with w.bloggar hasn't seemed to blow up the world."

    body: "From our friends at AT&T Broadband:\n\n\"We regret losing you as a customer and hope we may serve you again in the future. To avoid additional collection actions, you must settle your account balance immediately and return all cable equipment. Thank you.\"\n\nThis, as much as anything else, is why my exposure to the Full, Non-Stop, Continuing Coverage of the Anniversary of the Attack on America Under Attack on any of the major media outlets is today limited to whatever's on NPR, which is probably for the best, provided I resolve this dispute well in advance of next week's <a href=\"/survivor/\"><i>Survivor: Thailand</i></a> premiere.\n\nSo I spent far too much of yesterday and today working on the site, and among other things, I finally have a working Reader Service: if you use my <a href=\"/gleaner/\">Gleaner</a> news service and happen to have a Practicalmadness Reader ID, you'll find that you can now make your own damned bookmarks and quit mooching off of mine.\n\nI'm really proud of how I ended up doing the authentication page, partly because I've made it really easy for myself to add other services down the line, and mostly because I think that picture of keys on the login page looks cool.\n\nSo having solved that basic problem, I can add other much-needed features, like the ability to choose which sources are displayed on Gleaner (so that I can filter out Slashdot without having to impose my preference on every visitor), the ability to have your chosen Gleaner feeds e-mailed to you every morning, the ability to have Gleaner brush your teeth for you...\n\nSpeaking of feeds, <a href=\"http://www.plastic.com/\" target=\"gleaner\">Plastic</a> is now being Gleaned, which means that you can now link to a link which features mostly other links, which I think adds something to my piece. It gives it sort of a postmodern quality, kinda like, um, surrealism? It's, like, self-referential, and that's really nice. I like it.\n\n<i>Art student-mocking sponsored by 9/11&trade; Brand Patriotism: Why believe in your country when you can just mourn it?</i>"

    body: "Today is September 11th, and one year ago today -- at around this time, as a matter of fact -- terrorists linked to the Al-Qaeda network hijacked four commercial airliners and crashed them into both towers of NYC's World Trade Center, destroying it, the Pentagon (although it is now believed that plane's initial target was the White House) and a field in Pennsylvania -- an accident caused, it is believed, by the passengers after they learned that the plane was to be used as a weapon.\n\nAll of the major media outlets are using today for what they are describing with terms like 'mourning' and 'remembrance', but which stinks suspiciously of such more odious things as propaganda and marketing.\n\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/nationchallenged/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The New York Times</i></a>'s coverage: \"Maybe it is willful ignorance, some suggest.

Yeah, we're gonna need them now, 'cause we're at <i>Code Orange</i>! AAAAAAAH!!!\n\n\"Wait, what's this about my Starbucks cups?\" you ask. Damn. Said too much. (Takes suicide pill...)\n\n...But before I do that, <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/\" target=\"gleaner\"><i>The Onion</i></a> has <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/onion3833/second_birthday.html\" target=\"gleaner\">this story</a> of an area man whose life will never be the same after 9/11.\n\nAs for my own feelings on this day of indisputable infamy, <a href=\"/index_091102.php\">you may have already seen some of them</a>."

    body: "Netscape 7 has (finally) been released, and CNET has posted <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/software/0-3227883-8-20331576-1.html?tag=ld\" target=\"_blank\">this review</a>, which is a muted positive given that while Netscape 7 includes many cool new features (some missing from even the Mozilla 1.0 release it's based on, like an IM client compatible with both AIM and ICQ), it's laden down with ads from parent company AOL and is missing Mozilla 1.1's best feature, a pop-up ad blocker.\n\nIn summary:\n&middot; Netscape 7's default download-and-install package clocks in at 30 MB, whereas Mozilla (the browser which differs only in name...and, well, the pop-up blocker) is only 10 MB. The difference? By default, Netscape 7 installs RealOne Player and Winamp in addition to the browser.\n&middot; Netscape 7 incorporates all of Mozilla 1.1's tabbed browsing features, including the ability to group whole sets of pages into one bookmark. This is one Moz feature I haven't yet used once, but I can easily see applications for it; one could, for example, have one bookmark to load the MySQL documentation, PHP online manual <i>and</i> a Whack-A-Mole flash game for all those lovely coding jags.\n&middot; NS 7's mail client is far faster than in previous versions, and the aforementioned IM software now lets you sign onto both ICQ and AIM -- just not both at once. You have to choose one or the other, or just resort to a third-party chat application like Trillian.\n&middot; CNET raises a legitimate quibble over whether NS 7's Password Manager feature -- which stores your passwords in browser preferences so that you don't have to type and retype them -- is secure enough for use on banking or other eCommerce-type sites. This feature is unchanged from Mozilla 1.1, and while handy it may not be 100% safe, even if the passwords are living as files on your computer's hard drive and not on the live internet. CNET doesn't offer any conclusions, just raises it as one potential danger zone with this new class of browsers."

    description: "But look on the bright side: the gorilla is blue."
    body: "<b>1.</b> After wringing a few dozen shots out of an old, timerless La Marzocco espresso machine -- a process which can involve much hitting, grunting and swinging of heavy metal things -- I feel very much better.\n\n<b>2.</b> I didn't say too much about last night's relaunch of Practicalmadness Reader Services, so here's the skinny: Reader Services are interactive features which require registration. There are not currently any Reader Services on the site, although the first one -- the Survivor Game -- will launch later this week, and the long-awaited (by me) message board -- Cafe Practical -- will show up some time this month.\n\nThe scripts which handle logging in, logging out and registration are decent but not perfect, although everything should work fine 95% of the time for 95% of users, and will only get better. You can now log in (or out) from any recently-built Practical page, which should include nearly everything currently accessible from the homepage. Other pages will be phased in as necessary.\n\nWhat this means for you: there are flaws in my hastily whipped-together programs which can make signing up for and using Reader Services annoying, perhaps inconvenient, but not at all impossible, certainly not unenjoyable. And it will only get better.\n\n<b>3.</b> Imagine, if you will, a battle between cartoon characters, one shaped like a bottle of Pepsi Blue, the other shaped like a bottle of Dr. Pepper Red Fusion. Hold that image. It's funny.\n\nNow imagine, if you will, an ice blended creme beverage which shall remain nameless, but rhymes with 'Nappuccino,' and instead of being white, off-white, chocolate-colored or khaki, it is blue like big whales. This is not a Mountain Dew Blue Shock Slurpee, no, this is a smoother, more subtle drink with a hint of vanilla and the refreshing down-home goodness of blueberry pancake syrup.\n\nImagine this drink in the car cupholder of your worst enemy.\n\nSmile, as this is the thought that will get you through the latter eight hours of a twelve-hour workday that was only eight hours when you went to bed last night but grew while you were sleeping, and now is as like an 800-lb. gorilla, unchained, fists in pounding mode. Looking in your general direction. Angrily.\n\nBut look on the bright side: the gorilla is blue."

    title: "You will be fully cooperated. Resistance is futile."
    author: "ddemaree"

    body: "It occurs to me that in all the hustle and bustle of this week (ha!) I've forgotten to comment on this week's news, apparently largely ignored by the popular press*, that Microsoft has decided to give in to the government's demand that it open up the Windows source code to third-party developers in order to give them something resembling competitive parity with MS when it comes to building applications.\n\nIt's important that Microsoft has done this, rather than find a(nother) way to weasel out of it, but before any anti-Bill partisans start firing your laser tag guns into the heavens in triumph, please bear in mind the following two or three things:"
    extended: "(a) Microsoft is technically only required to release the source code to its current desktop Windows release -- which is (of course) Windows XP -- as the antitrust complaint only discusses Great White's unfair advantage in developing apps like, oh, I dunno, Internet Explorer.\n\n(b) Most Windows users --  nearly all of them, in fact -- are not running Windows XP yet, and may never be, because, well, Windows XP's processor requirements are so steep that many top of the line systems from as recent as two years ago cannot run it, and the RAM requirements (64 MB minimum-read-barely-adequate) keep all but the most recent models out of play. So most Windows users, nearly all of them, are using an older Windows OS which is officially obsolete, and therefore MS is under no obligation to open the code to those systems.\n\n(Incidentally, as of this summer, Windows 98 Second Edition is officially No Longer Supported by Microsoft. There is still one Win95-class system that hasn't yet been phased out (Windows Millennium Edition, aka Windows Me, aka Bob II: The Revenge) but users of Win98 are being advised to skip Me and go straight to XP.)\n\n(c) As the code release is for the current product only and not the entire platform -- which would include the code for *all* Windows releases going all the way back to Windows 95 when it could be argued MS began to use the OS as a marketing tool -- this code release won't do much to give developers some magical new knowledge of Windows's secret inner workings.\n\nIt will, however, serve as a major marketing coup for legions of developers whose commitment to developing for Windows may have flagged during the antitrust battle, for consumers who may mistake a slightly open WinXP for a trustworthy one (Passport and .NET will still be in there, folks) and for anyone whose opinion of MS might be swayed by a news story saying they were fully cooperating with the government's thorniest demand.\n\nIn short, this code release can only help Microsoft, and really doesn't do anything for the consumer, as those developers who would most benefit from an open Windows API have already developed some very effective workarounds, and often run faster and cleaner than their built-into-Windows equivalents.\n\nThis will give Internet Explorer a much-needed kick in the butt, and I'm sure we can expect new features in IE 7 more interesting than those found in the last couple (or three) releases, especially faced with the new threat from Netscape 7/Mozilla 1.0, Opera, iCab...\n\nOh, and as for Microsoft Office, let me clear something up: Anyone who thinks the only reason Office is so ubiquitous is because Microsoft is unfairly using their magic Windows secrets has probably never even <i>used</i> Office, probably because they can't afford it (a valid complaint), and therefore may not have even considered that it may simply be a better product than...StarOffice? Corel WordPerfect? You want me to defend these things over my Office? HA!"

And here we are stuck with these stupid one-tuplets!\"</b>\n\n<b>1.</b> After months of threats, Pepsi has finally unleashed upon an unsuspecting world the horror that is <a href=\"http://www.pepsiblue.com/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Pepsi Blue</a>, which in addition to being inherently <i>wrong</i> can also be ranked with the growing list of things abusing the word \"fusion\". The label describes the soda as a \"berry cola fusion\", which is perhaps a more artful way of saying \"ohmigod, it's fuckin' blueberry Pepsi!\"\n\nThe taste is actually not bad, in the same way that Crystal Pepsi tasted a lot better after they gave up on the whole clear cola thing and made it mostly a citrus drink. This is to say that I taste blueberry, and I taste cola, but overall the taste is Pepsi Blue, which should keep my interest about as long as Dr. Pepper Red Fusion did. (Number of Red Fusions bought last week: 2-3. Number bought this week: 0.)"

    body: "<b>It</b> is well-known that there comes a point in the life of anyone (or at least any non-yuppie non-Republican American) at which one looks around at their environment and, still drunk on hope for the future, gets mad. Allow me to posit that there is a further point in the life of said American at which the rage at the status quo becomes the status quo, and therefore passe, and is actually two or three levels of passe, so we're talking boredom across multiple exponential levels here, which is more than most human minds (as well as some cats) would care to deal with.\n\n<b>Allow</b> me to further posit that when you spend the vast majority of your usable waking hours explaining to someone (who isn't listening anyway) why an Americano is better than Folgers, or why they really never want to drink French Vanilla Cappuccinos from that machine in the grocery store ever again, etc., you begin to lose faith in humanity (read: the wisdom of the American people to come in out of the rain, much less order coffee) as it becomes clear that these things which -- I hope we're all in agreement on this -- suck are simply good enough for most people.\n\n<b>And</b> it's so frustrating, speaking as one who thinks they know the difference between good and bad things, to constantly have to explain why something you believe in on a very simple, basic level (be it theory, love, your work or even the joy of drinking an Americano instead of burnt drip coffee from Dunkies) is worth considering.\n\n<b>And</b> when you have to explain your most basic thoughts and feelings to <i>everyone you meet</i>, and at best just see them parroted back to you but filtered through the expectations and prejudices of whoever you're talking to...it just becomes very hard to have an opinion about anything anymore because you'll never be able to convince anyone besides yourself, and may never really be able to talk to anyone besides yourself, and so you can never really matter since you're not the one writing the history books, and you can't just be responsible only to yourself. That's too limiting. But you can't be all things to all people. That's insane.\n\n<b>And</b> it becomes clear that your relevance within the broader context of our media culture -- please, it hasn't been about God, country and/or family for a very, very long time --  is to be decided by people who really only want to see themselves in you. Either that, or they want to see how much you can spend, and so those bohemian artists who starved in garrets and redefined art and literature in the 19th and 20th Centuries would just be starving idiots with Art Institute degrees looking for work at Starbucks this fall, and getting <i>so</i> frustrated when the 2,000th housewife from Wisconsin asks for a French Vanilla Cappuccino."

This will save me the thirty minutes I just had to spend de-spamming my Inbox, but will also severely curtail my access to penis enlargement, great business opportunities and Wacky William's Daily Wack.\n\n<b>2.

It's a cherry-infused version of Dr. Pepper which is quite similar to a far more obscure (and far more storied) <a href=\"http://www.cheerwine.com/\" target=\"_new\">Southern soda</a>; this can only be a good thing.

    body: "<b>\"One thing I really like in IV is we learn how to pronounce Hermione, her-MY-oh-nee\" - An Amazon.com product review of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></b>\n\nA few months ago <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/\" target=\"_new\">Amazon.com</a> began quietly testing an XML interface to allow webmasters to display customized product information on their sites, i.e., letting people with web scripting skillz tap the power of Amazon's leviathan-like product catalog without having to send eyeballs away from the puce-on-chartreuse glory of their own sites. In typical fashion, the grousing began immediately.\n\nThe first complaint was over the paucity of the provided data (\"can't we get prices in our XML?\"). The loudest was over the inflexibility of same (\"can't we do single-item searches so we can basically mirror Amazon and never, ever have to visit your site again?\", \"can't we have more than 10 entries a page so we can crash your server three times a day instead of just once?\").\n\nAmazon has now responded in such a way as to quiet all arguments, as Associates XML has been replaced by <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/webservices/\" target=\"_new\">Amazon.com Web Services</a>. Want access to <i>all</i> the data? Want to show individual products? Feel brave enough to use SOAP instead of plain XML? Yup, we can do that. They even provide the full text of up to three customer reviews, and a method for adding items to an Amazon.com shopping cart, wish list or gift registry directly from your page, eliminating the need to browse any Amazon.com pages until it's time to complete your purchase.\n\nWhy are they doing this? Note (as I have) that while it is compatible with <a href=\"http://associates.amazon.com/\" target=\"_new\">Associates</a> (Amazon's long-running affiliate network, which gives site owners an up-to-15% cut of purchases made by referrals), Web Services is a completely separate program which they are adopting most likely to get increasingly revenue-strapped sites to link to them, as well as to tap into the ingenuity of a sales force which may come up with an entirely new way of reaching customers just because it's easy and fun."

    body: "You gotta love secondhand bookstores. (No, you don't understand -- you <i>gotta</i>. I command it.) Having discovered what it takes to get us off a Clark Bus before our stop -- \"ALL COOKBOOKS 50% OFF\" -- we went into the Bookman's Corner, which is perhaps the world's most disorderly bookshop. Books are strewn everywhere. In fact, they comprise 60% of the proprietor's furniture.\n\nHis credit card imprinter (yes, he still uses an imprinter) sits on top of a huge pile of books, right next to his more modern credit card terminal which also sits atop a huge pile of books. His work table is missing a leg, but not to worry -- we have books for that too. (Mostly remaindered, large print John Grisham, but that may just be wishful thinking.)\n\nToday it was too warm for much extreme browsing, but we still made it out with a Frugal Gourmet cookbook (\$2.50), a coffee handbook (which is probably not as nice as my bible, <i>Coffee Basics</i>, but it was 50 cents), <i>Hello, He Lied</i> by movie producer Lynda Obst (\$3) and <i>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics</i>, a book about how polls are used to artificially shape public opinion. This book was published in the late 1970s, so one can only assume the author has now either moved to a remote mountain cabin, shot himself in the head, or shot others in the head and is now locked away safely somewhere."

It was everything one should expect from high school students performing classical theater under a tent in the middle of a park on a Sunday night, plus a really loud Prospero and a lithe, blonde and flailing Caliban. I now find myself the third (or seventh) wheel to my brother, his friends and his girlfriend, who is much more (a) female and (b) gothy than I had expected, considering my brother wears silky Savane slacks and other quite yuppish things.\n\nThe itinerary for the week involves three nights at the family homestead in Birmingham including a homecoming to the Starbucks shop where I was hired, trained and came to believe in a company which has since demoralized myself and countless others through the magic of Sudden, Violent Changes In Management. Three other nights (not necessarily in this order) will be spent on the Gulf Coast between Mobile (where there will be tall ships) and New Orleans (where there will be, well, New Orleans). I return to Chicago on Saturday and will finally (finally!) get to go to a Taste of Chicago with Jenny on Sunday afternoon. After work. (Pained shudder.)"

Don't ever tell me it's not a good plan! <i>Who are you to tell me it's not a good plan?!?!</i>\n\n<b>5.</b> Next million-dollar invention: kittyproof network cards for laptops."

    description: "For you see, no tech may lay their hands upon an unlicensed computer for fear of being torn limb from limb by ravenous lawyers."
    body: "Due to an unfortunate...unpleasantness involving <a href=\"http://www.iomega.com/\">this</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/\">that</a> and the other, my beloved laptop has been out of commission for four days. It's back now, but saving it required Herculean feats of check card-lifting and much stress as I battled the twin devils of jerky tech support staff and the far deeper horror of the EULA. For you see, no tech may lay their hands upon an unlicensed computer for fear of being torn limb from limb by ravenous lawyers.\n\nThe fix involved buying a copy of Windows 2000 Professional (uh, I mean, buying a <i>new</i> copy, as I would never dream of running unlicensed software...) after attempts to fix everything using a set of floppy disks (yes, they still exist) proved ineffective. Of course, I would learn later that I could have fixed it easily that first night, with the floppies, but then I would not have been sufficiently punished for my foolishness. I have now had to run the Emergency Repair process four times, CHK the DISK once, reinstall twice and once I could get into my computer's filesystem to save three years of work files (having converted my drive to NTFS, the Windows 2000-native demon filesystem, I could not use a Windows 98 disk for anything but a coaster), reformat my hard drive and start over.\n\nIn the process I lost:\n\n<blockquote>&#149; Microsoft Word 2000\n&#149; Adobe Illustrator\n&#149; Macromedia Flash\n&#149; All of my fonts (only because I forgot to back them up)</blockquote>\n\nFortunately I had recently taken steps to ensure that the <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/dreamweaver/\">software</a> most <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/photoshop/\">integral</a> to Practicalness was backed up onto CD.\n\nWhat have we learned? When a buddy shows up with a pirated operating system, don't let him leave town in the middle of the night until you've taken the ten minutes to make a gahdamned copy of the CD."

    body: "<b>1.</b> I will be away from Chicago during all of Independence Day week as I celebrate my ongoing need to suckle at the warm, happy, rancid teat that is my dysfunctional family. During that week -- June 30 through July 6 -- I will be bouncing between New Orleans, Mobile, AL, and Birmingham, and likely will not be updating, thinking about updating or in any position to use my fingers in a constructive manner. However, as a result of this mission, a certain fuzzy sidekick will be returning to the Practical family. (heh heh heh. feel the fuzziness. it is your dea-- ooh, fudge!)\n\n<b>2.</b> Slinging my 2,000(,000)th Name Brand Ice Blended Beverage at <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">work</a> today, I finally hit upon a new paradigm for the site. My long-planned community features (user reg, message boards, etc.) will be set up alongside recipes for bizarro coffee drinks and tales from the front lines of the War Against Incorrect Drink Ordering in a new subsite called \"Practical's Coffee Shop and Discount Brothel\" (title still in beta). This got me going on a whole slew of ideas for other subsites: the movie reviews and Cine Calendar could live in \"The Screening Room\", et al. I don't know yet, however, how this fits in with the oh-so-staid <a href=\"/beta/\">New Design</a> I debuted this morning...\n\n<b>3.</b> I could write at length about the split decision by the Supreme Court that putting mentally retarded criminals to death is unconstitutional, but rather than keep us all here until dawn, allow me to make just the following observation: the news, which occupied a three-column, 72-point headline on Friday's <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, was deemed not so newsworthy by the editors and designers at the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i>. Both papers gave the story a large-type headline above the fold, but readers put off by the <i>Trib</i>'s wordy look and tone of journalistic competence may find themselves believing that their paper's film reviewer's four-star advertisement for <i>Minority Report</i> or a rumored change to multicolor printing at the U.S. Mint is truly more important."

    title: "Becoming untouchable"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "We here at Practical care about you all very deeply.* (* - Denotes lies.)"
    body: "Today's challenges: making it though a workday without lashing out irrationally, making it through a Journal item without ever mentioning <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/\">my workplace</a> again, and finishing said journal entry entirely within the space of four minutes.\n\nMy current project is the completion of my first screenplay, <i>Two or Three Things You Should Know About Mike Morpheus</i>. That is to say, that is the project I am supposed to be working on, but instead I've been spending lots <i>and lots</i> of time at Peet's Coffee, and building my ingenious Movable Type-killer app, Practical Publisher. (Features so far include the ability to import new entries from any existing HTML page, regardless of the formatting. Future features will include the ability to import from files, make Graphical Blogs, and-- oh, hell, you don't care. You're here for the sardonicness.)\n\n<b>Thwack!</b> This is the sound of me throwing in the towel, embracing this thing and giving up on my dream of building The Blogging System That Is Like Movable Type Only PHP-Based Oh And Better. And as I work on the newest redesign of Practical -- this time focused on content and a very, <i>very</i> spare page design -- I find that Movable gives me all the power I need to make the Practical of my dreams, that is to say, one that requires a minimum of effort on my part.\n\n(What turned me around? Mostly seeing how much better Movable was working than my homegrown solution. And how much fun I was having editing plain old HTML using my newest toy, <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/dreamweaver/\">Dreamweaver MX</a>. And how much more easily I'm breathing now that I don't have to fuck with building a fully-fledged Web App.\n\nIn a near-future installment, I shall tell of my battle with vampire jewelers (no, really!) in the Loop, of the growing madness of my cat Sophie, of such films as \"Lilo & Stitch\", \"13 Conversations About One Thing\", \"Insomnia\" and, of course, \"Minority Report\", and of whatever else is going on.\n\nAnd if you are now, or have ever been, subscribed to the Practical newsletter <i>Communique</i>, dust off that spam filter: I am going to try to write Communique 6.01 in the coming weeks to see if it'll fly. Be afraid. Be kinda afraid.\n\nOh, that reminds me of a couple of things:\n\n1. \"Scooby-Doo\" -- it doesn't <i>totally</i> suck, although it's more successful as a joke on the performers (AHEM Freddie Prinze, Jr. AHEM AHEM AHEM) than as its own movie. That said, it's the sort of remake that brings to mind Cameron Crowe's comparing an all-too-faithful remake to 'your band covering that one song you really liked' -- a tribute more than anything else, and as evidenced by Roger Ebert's <i>Sun-Times</i> review, if you're not up for some really, really inside jokes, you may as well go see <i>Hot Mexican Sex Action</i>, uh, I mean <i>Y Tu Mama Tambien</i> again. Full review? Maybe if I feel like it.\n\n2. Practical's long-dormant No Subject discussion list has been invaded by spammers this week. I haven't yet taken any action; most likely I will shut down the list or switch it over to a moderated discussion, which shouldn't affect anyone as nobody was using the list anyway. We here at Practical care about you all very deeply* and hope nobody was offended, harmed or sexually excited by any unsolicited junk e-mail forced upon you by way of our mailing list.

    title: "\"Aloha!\", or: A Week in review"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Always stronger than kitty suspects."
    body: "<b>1.</b> Sophie, our Companion Animal Deluxe, has discovered the joys of stalking the elusive Blue Marlin Attached To A String. The Marlin is a cagey character, usually attached to a plastic fishing pole being held by one of Sophie's humans, and always stronger than kitty suspects. She doggedly persists in stalking it, certain that she will discover a way to magically turn it into food, or at least a treat from her masters for subduing the beast for them.\n\n<b>2.</b> Stitch, the little fuzzy blue alien starring in this summer's Disney Instant Classic&trade;, <i>Lilo & Stitch</i>, is the cutest-wutest thing on six legs. A 24-inch plushie version of hims has joined the household, where he has won an appointment to the coveted position of cuddly bedtime aminal.\n\nWe first became aware of Stitch through Disney's rather brilliant TV campaign for the film, in which he is being held up to the sun in <i>The Lion King</i>'s \"Circle of Life\" scene instead of little Simba. \"Hey, wait! You're not Simba!\" shouts Timon , standing on Pumbaa's head. Cut to close-up of cute-wute widdle six-armed, antennaed Stitch: \"Aloha!\"\n\nDisney's 'pitch' for the film is that it, like Stitch, is not quite your older brother/sister's Disney movie, which likely did not feature adorable space monsters or completely lack celebrity voice talent. Stitch is actually a stock Disney character -- the lovable misfit, who like the Ugly Duckling finds a place where he, too, can belong and be happy and buy more toys. But he <i>is</i> the first Disney character to be a destructive little creature with a gaping, toothy maw.\n\nWell, apart from Michael Eisner.\n\n<b>3.</b> I finally managed to see <i>Insomnia</i>, and a review (believe it or not) is forthcoming. 20-second verdict: <i>ehhh.</i> The movie (directed by <i>Memento</i>'s Christopher Nolan, and starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams) follows the plot of the original Norwegian version to the letter (excepting the addition of a grating 'Nancy Drew' persona for Hilary Swank's local cop, and the removal of any sex whatsoever) until the grafted-on ending, which comes down to a shoot-out (of course), a catch-phrase (uh-huh) and much death. I posited years ago in my first film criticism class (back in high school) that American movies have a remarkable obsession with deaths signifying closure at the end of the film -- that U.S. audiences will not consider the story closed until someone has died, whereas European filmmakers (for example; in this case we were discussing Mike Leigh's <i>Secrets & Lies</i>) are much more willing to leave some loose ends laying about.\n\nLook at the endings to <i>Fight Club</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>: the former is resolved (dramatically, at least) by a gunshot wound to the head, leaving massive plot holes but few moral dilemmas as the more sympathetic antihero manages to survive and get the girl. Kubrick's <i>Clockwork Orange</i> ends with the antihero restored to his former, sociopathic self -- this time with government backing. The movie denies us that warm, happy closed feeling -- nobody has died, and nobody is about to die. Something totally ridiculous is happening, we're in the shit and Kubrick up and leaves us there.\n\nNolan's <i>Insomnia</i> works best for me right now as a quick-and-easy roadmap to the original Skjoldbaerg film, as well as a showcase for a welcome return by Robin Williams to non-cloying dramatic material. Pacino is also...accomplished in the film, but much of the performance seems too easy. Stellan Skarsgaard (who played Pacino's part in the original) was much more subdued and psychological, whereas Pacino is very physical. There is a lot of subtlety in the <i>working</i> of Pacino's approach, but it still hits the viewer over the head like a celluloid sledgehammer.\n\nAnyway, all this and more in the Review You Will Never See."

    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "This entry will deal mostly with geek thi-- oh, look, here comes the CTA supervisor. He's gonna kick some #22 ass."
    body: "They're saying XML will be one of these panacea technologies which changes the way we use the internet, et al, stuff like that, yada, etc. That doesn't mean it's anything one can manage to tame in a couple of hours on their day off, as evidenced by my so-far-unsuccessful attempts to use Movable Type's built-in RSS feed to put my own blog on my own front page.\n\nI'm sure there's a reason why the designers of PHP needed to make the process of building an XML-parsing function so damned complex, and yet still so useless. I am still holding out hope that one day, when I have my shit together, I'll be able to use PHP, XML and MySQL to unify all of my various types of Practical content into one happy, handy, easy-to-use tool.\n\nI am hampered by the fact that, well, oftentimes I can only manage to steal so much time from the evil demons Sleep and Starbucks, and most of that I'd rather devote to Jenny.\n\nMoving on: After screwing the pooch so forcefully with Versions 4.0 (first beta) through 6.0 (initial \"final\" release), Netscape finally has a decent browser again. The preview release of <a href=\"http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/7/\">Netscape 7.0</a> incorporates all of the good stuff from Netscape 6.2 and adds some of the latest new stuff from the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a> 1.0 release, including a new (allegedly) Opera-like \"tabbed\" interface (where different web pages are displayed on different tabs instead of different windows, saving tons of screen real estate not to mention system resources) and a full-screen display ripped off from IE.\n\nThese are just little tweaks to make an already useful app a little moreso; what really puts Netscape 7 back in the game is that it loads and runs about as quickly as IE can, which is pretty amazing when you consider that since version 5 IE has been literally built into the guts of the Windows OS.\n\n(Speaking of Mozilla 1.0, while poking around for a list of Moz's current feature set, I am reading that the CVS source tree for Moz 1.0 has been cut. This is collaborative-coder-speak for \"please fasten your seat belts, put your seats in their upright position -- we're ready to fly.\" Yay. I was one who rejoiced when Netscape opened the source to Communicator back in 1998, creating the Mozilla project. And now, four years later, they've managed to create one finished piece of software. Like I said, yay.)\n\nMoving on: Yesterday I began playing with <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/\">O'Reilly & Associates</a>'s <a href=\"http://safari.oreilly.com/\">Safari</a> e-book subscription service, which denies you the ability to look at all the pretty-colored O'Reilly book spines on your shelf or to learn about the origins of a dodo bird and PHP all within the same book, but other than that must be the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nSafari is sort of an e-text version of Netflix. O'Reilly books tend to retail for \$30-50 -- not so atypical for computer books, but O'Reilly titles are unique for two reasons:\n\n1. The company is committed to selling only books that are more authoritative than anything else out there, or cover topics that nobody else has touched yet.\n\n2. Apparently the wholesale price of any given O'Reilly title is so close to their upmarket cover price that it is nearly impossible to find them marked down until they're out of date, even on Amazon.com.\n\nIn short, they're the Criterion Collection or Arden Shakespeare of computer books, and Safari gives you access to the full text of their entire catalog, with some restrictions. Like Netflix, you can only have a certain number of titles \"checked out\" depending on your membership level. For example, I signed up for their \$9.95/mo \"5-point\" subscription, giving me access to five titles worth one point each. Some books, like O'Reilly's \"pocket reference\" series, are worth only half a point, while others are worth two or three. The vast majority are one-pointers.\n\nLike Netflix, you can only have access to new titles once you've turned in your old ones. The one catch is that you are only allowed to subscribe to new titles once a month on your \"swap date\" (your billing date).\n\n(Actually, you can subscribe to new titles without returning old ones by upgrading your membership. Safari subscriptions are designed to be adjusted every month, so if you need access to ten titles one month, you can simply pay for a 10-point subscription one month and return all the extra books the following month and automatically go back to the cheaper membership. They only charge you for what you're using and not a penny more.)\n\nSo several O'Reilly books I didn't care to bother with -- <i>Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL</i> (which has gotten so-so reviews), <i>HTML & XHTML</i> (which I want solely for the XHTML chapter) and <i>Running Weblogs with Slash</i> (do you see Slash running here?) -- are now available to me, as are others I didn't care to pay \$50 for (<i>Managing and Using MySQL</i>).\n\nOh, look, here comes the CTA supervisor. He's gonna kick some #22 ass."
    extended: "This entry will deal mostly with geek things. If you fear such things, turn away now. Uh, I mean, keep reading until you find something you like. The topics covered herein include: XML and PHP, Netscape 7.0 Preview Release and O'Reilly's Safari subscription service."

    body: "I have only this to say: having worked in a technical support department where the last letter in DSL was often replaced with a certain four-letter word it rhymes with, and \"provisioning\" was the means by which the Big Telco In The Sky fucked up customer and support tech alike...well, I'm surprised to say that my DSL self-installation has been so *fucking* easy it's insane.\n\nThe hardest part was calling SBC Ameritech to get them to issue a temporary username and password. See, I'm used to a school network where there is no need for a user/password -- you just get on. Cable modems and some DSL providers work the same way, but Ameritech uses PPPoE (that's Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), and as such the only differences between ADSL and dialup are the speed and the need to dial-in. Basically, our DSL line is always on, but we have to log onto the network to browse.\n\nThat said, the new SpeedStream router I bought so Jenny and I could share the DSL line has a built-in PPPoE client so to us it will seem just like we're back home on the old ethernet.\n\nNow to find enough Ethernet cable to reach across the room to my desk..."

    title: "Practical catness"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Her love is real, but so are her claws."
    body: "Meet Sophie. Sophie weighs less than three pounds. Sophie is smaller than a breadbox. Sophie has taken over our apartment. Sophie is a cat, actually an illegal feline alien in this apartment, and her demands are as follows:\n\n1. More food!\n2. No, not that food!\n\nWe adopted Sophie from The Anti-Cruelty Society after bonding with two cats at PAWS Chicago because, well, PAWS is more of a club for Lincoln Park yuppies who want to feel like they're part of the solution, whereas the Anti-Cruelty is more concerned with, you know, finding homes for kitties than with such worldly matters as minimum age requirements.\n\nIt all began a week ago -- our day off -- when we went to PAWS (an acronym for \"Pets Are Worth Saving\"), whose public kitty shelter is open weekdays from 6-8 pm, and is conveniently located about four blocks south of us on Clark Street. There I tried to pierce the icy veneer of an aloof Russian Blue named Vera, and Jenny decided that a big tabby named Lucky was the bestest cat who'd ever catted a cat.\n\n\"Look at him,\" she said of Lucky. \"He's just so...cat!\"\n\"Of course; that's his schtick.\"\n\"I don't think I'm ready to live in a city where the cats have schtick!\"\n\nWe decided that Lucky was the cat for us, and asked to initiate the adoption procedure. Then, suddenly, we were shot down -- we were perfect, we just are neither of us 25. The adoption counselor -- wearing that Corporately Concerned expression (registered trademark of Katie Couric, all rights reserved) -- explained to us over and over that she's sure we're great <i>kids</i>, she's just had so many problems, we're great <i>kids</i>, this one 21-year-old's roommate once let a half-dozen cats loose and only one was ever found, <i>kidsssss</i>, over and over until we were out the door and screaming for pamby yuppie blood.\n\nCompare this with the procedure at Anti-Cruelty: we came in. We met the kitties. We found the bestest kitty ever. We were sent downstairs with a form. We filled out the form. After 20 minutes, a shelter volunteer showed us into a windowless room and reviewed our responses. She *corrected* our adoption application as if it were last week's geometry quiz.\n\nAnd apparently we got a passing score, because after another twenty minutes she returned with our then-nameless cat's file and said she was ours. Twenty minutes later we had paid the fee, signed the contract and our new kitty was handed to us in a cardboard carrier, newly outfitted with a tracking microchip.\n\n(Major animal shelters have now begun to implant AVID permanent ID microchips into homeless cats' necks, giving them effectively a kitty serial number. If Sophie were ever to turn up missing, we could call the City Pound, the Anti-Cruelty, PAWS, et al. and ask if a kitty with AVID ID number <i>x</i> had been brought in recently, and we could claim her with our copy of her registration sticker. Yes, she is a living thing, with a tracking ID which can be read by a radio device. I'm scared too.)\n\nSophie's litter box dominates a large corner of our tiny apartment, while her food dishes occupy the spot right by my feet at my desk, so I am constantly interrupted by Sophie's yowls for kitty lovin': \"Pet me! Love me! <i>Feed me!!</i>\"\n\nHer favoritest thing in the whole world is her catnip mouse, so special to her that she hides it under the bed."

    title: "The tribe is pissy"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Then -- finally -- fire shoots out of everyone's mouths and Probst's smirk reigns over the flaming wreckage of sanity. Yep, <i>Survivor</i> is finally back."
    body: "After almost two years of waiting for a <i>Survivor</i> cast to be as argumentative and nasty as the original crew, last night we finally got a bitchfest worthy of the reality genre.\n\nHaving eliminated every member of the once-dominant Rotu Alliance, Kathy (the grating hippie real estate agent), Paschal (the earnest Southern judge), Neleh (Paschal's pixie-chick sidekick), Sean (the Black Panther-by-way-of-Chris Tucker) and Vecepia (the mildly creepy corporate manager-cum-other token black contestant) are the final five, but they have a problem: their alliance is actually more a confederacy of smaller alliances, specifically Paschal/Neleh (who have a father/daughter thing as well as a god thing going on) and Sean/Vecepia (who bonded as the only black people in the game, as well as a god thing going on), loosely joined at the hip by Kathy who has been in danger of being voted off since day one. Basically, each of the smaller alliances (which conveniently don't consider themselves to be alliances) believes that the others are going to target them for being too powerful, and their response to this threat is to, well, ally with the other member of their non-alliance.\n\nAre you still following this? If yes, you've been watching the show. If not, don't worry about it -- all that matters is that Vee, in her corporate creepiness, decides that they need to <i>open up a dialogue</i> and <i>discuss their feelings as a group</i>. Which they do, although I don't think an evening of slinging accusations back and forth like crazed lawyers is what she had in mind.\n\nThe reward challenge was the dreaded \"super-challenge\", a six-part obstacle course comprised of elements from six previous challenges. Sean wins it easily (the first two or three stages were from the only challenges he did really, really well) and gets a new Saturn VUE. Yes, that's right, a new Saturn VUE. Cue glamour shots of Sean in his new car. Cut to shiny red exterior of the car. Pan over the sleek, feature-packed dashboard. Ooooooh, shiny. Caaaar. Must buy one right now!\n\nThe immunity challenge was another rehash, the \"Blair Witch\" challenge where the Survivors must listen to and then remember a local folktale, and the first person to answer five questions about it correctly is immune from the next vote. Kathy and Neleh are neck and neck, but then each drops a tiki toy on the way to the finish line. Kathy finds hers first, and wins the Ugliest Necklace Ever.\n\nAt Tribal Council, the super-bitch-fest that is to come starts when host Jeff Probst prods Kathy into putting her Immunity necklace up for sale, and Sean comes out to pledge his <i>and</i> Vecepia's votes in exchange for immunity. Kathy -- a little too happy to have this much power over the game -- starts slamming Sean/Vee for having an alliance and then lying about it. Paschal jumps in. Sean slams Paschal for having an alliance with Neleh and then lying about it. Neleh (<i>sooo cuuute...</i>) says she and Paschal don't have an alliance, they just promised never to vote each other off. Sean's head explodes at the idea that they could promise never to vote for each other and not consider that an alliance. Vecepia says they need to explore areas of opportunity for bonding and attaining tribal synergy. Then -- finally, for the first time this season -- fire shoots out of everyone's mouths and Probst's Mephistophilean smirk reigns over the flaming wreckage of sanity. Yep, <i>Survivor</i> is finally back.\n\nAnyway, Sean was voted out, 3-2. (Guess which three and you win a cookie.)\n\nThe Final Four are: Kathy, Paschal, Neleh and Vecepia. They will fight it out for the million-dollar cash prize this Sunday on the two-hour finale, then give it all back just to stop the hammering in their heads as they are forced to endure the worst torment yet: the live, hour-long Reunion special hosted by Rosie O'Donnell. (Which will be worse? Having to be around Sarah and the Robfathah again, or Rosie? Only one way to find out...)"

    description: "We have shared a collective weiner experience."
    body: "Following on the other night's entry about the Weiner's Circle: when Jenny and I first went there all we knew is that it was very well-reviewed on CitySearch. I brought it up in Directing class today as an example of an environment where truth is stranger than fiction, and nearly everyone in the class then chimed in with their own story about the place.\n\nCLASSMATE: \"I've been called 'honey', 'bitch'...\nME: \"I think if you can get outta there only having been called 'honey' or 'bitch', you're getting off easy...\"\n\nIt came up because some of my fellow wannabe directors -- specifically the ones who were performing my piece -- were having trouble with some of the lines. I personally don't understand what's so wrong about a character saying \"he <i>dreams</i>...the stars were gone from his eyes...\", etc. I guess there's just no room for operatic melodrama anymore.\n\nBridgit, the girl playing my femme fatale, understood what I was going for and cited <i>Gone With The Wind</i>. (<a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Name?Bordowitz,+Gregg\">Gregg</a> hit the nail on the head, mentioning the films of <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Name?Sirk,+Douglas\">Douglas Sirk</a>.) Bridgit's problem was with the sexual dialogue (\"Then I guess I'd touch you while he fucked you up the ass...selfish! Selfish bitch!\", et al.), and having said that I'm not sure if her flatter-than-the-rehearsal delivery was awkwardness or revenge. It doesn't matter: the piece went over well, and provided I can brain-fart a few pages of brilliance on Brecht, Godard and <i>Weekend</i> in the next 45 minutes, all should be well.\n\nWhich is good, because I have less than five days to vacate my dorm room, and in nearly every case so far getting credit for my classes has been a close call. I even have an incomplete in Screenwriting because my professor, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\"><i>Chicago Tribune</i></a> film critic John Petrakis, decided that <i>Two or Three Things You Should Know About Mike Morpheus</i>, my first feature-length script, was too good to be abandoned 48 pages in.\n\nAnd so I see my future: writing elegant, operatic scripts where people brandish the word \"cunt\" like a knife."

    body: "When your first encounter with your new apartment lasted less than five minutes, and your second had the place gutted, ripped apart and undergoing rehabbing, on third glance one might be so glad just to have a <i>floor</i> that you don't initially notice the little things.\n\nAnd in hindsight, I'm kind of glad that the workmen who cleaned and rehabbed our apartment decided to cover all the window locks with a half-gallon each of white Sherwin-Williams special recipe; I pity the robber who's gonna have to get through that, mostly because they have to be seriously mentally incorrect not to have broken the glass.\n\nAnd not being able to close the bathroom door because somebody doesn't know the Spanish word for 'scrape'? That's fine, I guess, but now we get to watch each other wee, and just when you thought we couldn't get any closer (physically)...well, let's not go there. Suffice to say, it will all be moot when the fumes from our \$1.95 gas oven (complete with two stove burners whose pilots have gone out) kill us in our sleep.\n\nOr more likely, kills me and then kills Jenny when I drool on the Pergo(tm) flooring and she slips and falls to her death.\n\nStill beats dying in our 65-year-old elevator."

    body: "Gee, is there really anything to say this morning?\n\nI had better say something, as <a href=\"http://www.screenz.com/\">this computer</a> is costing me \$0.14/minute. Our move into a new apartment is going about as smoothly as it should, considering that Jenny's family decided they were so excited to help us that they should show up a full day early necessitating speed-packing, hasty, panicked phone calls to our building manager and leaving roughly half a ton of my possessions behind to bring up later in grocery bags.\n\nAnd in crunching the numbers for our monthly expenses -- so far including rent, electric, telephone, DSL that won't be installed for another three weeks and Cable TV (all other utilities are included) -- I hear a piercing squeaking sound.\n\nWe were going to wait for DSL -- I mean, who needs high-speed net access when you get free dial-up through your school and live one block away from a cybercafe? -- but Ameritech didn't feature that, and were so desperate to sell us a DSL line that they offered us a ludicrous rate. How ludicrous? I don't know how many of you, dear readers, use broadband, or how much you're paying for it. Suffice to say, you probably don't want to know, and Ameritech doesn't want me to tell you. So neener neener <i>neener</i>.\n\nWe were also going to wait for cable TV, but, well...here's how cable TV works: the most basic cable TV package costs \$40 for all the \"expanded\" basic channels (CNN, MTV, Nickelodeon, et al) but no premiums or digital channels. A digital package including four channels of HBO and two dozen extra Digital Cable channels (including Sundance, IFC and BBC America) is \$50. I used the \"honey, we spend more than that on <i>lattes</i>\" argument.\n\nThis is the sound of me succumbing to the self-absorbed blogger impulse. <i>Squeeeeeeek.</i>"

He asked for paper, and wrote \"French Vanilla Coffee\".\n\nI wrote back, \"we don't have *french* vanilla, is plain okay?\" He shook his head. He wrote half a sentence then stopped. He had a sign-language argument with the woman he was with, and studied the menu very carefully. Then he wrote, \"Med Iced Tea\". I even confirmed the order, flipping the sheet over and writing, \"a medium plain iced tea?\" He nodded. I rang in his order and took his money. I then signalled 'halt', then pointed to myself, then pointed to the cold beverage counter and then back to the Whole Bean Counter where I was standing. This was to signify, of course, that the deaf couple should stay there while I fetched their iced tea. He nodded.\n\nI got the tea and gave it to him. He fumbled for paper again, and I gave it back to him. He wrote, \"lemon slice\". I shook my head and held up my hands, and he understood that we didn't have any.

    title: "The haute cuisine of food"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Eat your Thumper, dear."
    body: "<b>\"Did you have a earthquake, Mr. Kodos?\"</b>\n\nThe highlight of the past two days has been the Best Meal Ever at <a href=\"http://www.zagat.com/search/Details.asp?RID=2139&NDPH=Bistrot+Zinc&VID=1&PID=1&LID=20\">Bistrot Zinc</a> on North State. BZ was my idea; Jenny had originally picked Bistro 110 on Pearson (next to the Ghirardelli Chocolate Bar, conveniently located to post-dinner sweetness) after reading a favorable review on Citysearch, but when we got there the menu was a little, well, <i>French</i>. That is to say, traditionally French to the point of boredom, whereas Bistrot Zinc was not nearly so strait-laced.\n\nWe both ordered from the monthly specials menu (it quotes Eliot's The Waste Land, e.g.: \"April is the cruellest month\", then extols fiddlehead ferns). Practically we should have left it to just entrees, but we ended up getting a full three-course meal.\n\nThe appetizer was rabbit rillettes with fresh greens and croutons. For those not familiar with French cuisine, perhaps this description will be more vivid for you: homemade paste of rabbit liver with tiny fragrant leaves, mustard seeds and tiny pieces of hardened bread. This was okay by itself, and really good when Jenny told me it was okay to combine the rabbit pate and mustard with our crusty bread and butter. (\"Eat your Thumper, dear,\" she said.)\n\nMmm, Thumper yummy.\n\nThen we moved onto Bambi's mom. No, just kidding, we had Porky and Donald instead. Her entree consisted of grilled duck in a blood orange reduction with sauteed frisee and onion confit. \"This is the best meal I ever had!\" she said. The duck was cooked medium rare such that I swear you could still hear it quacking...\n\nI had the French take on the Hungry-Man plate: pig, mashed potatoes with sour cream and greens. More accurately, it was a succulent grilled pork chop in a port deglace with fiddlehead ferns -- almost impossible to get, let alone do justice to, according to Jenny -- and pwecious Peruvian purple potatoes (mashed, of course) served with mustard creme fraiche.\n\nMy culinary opinion is that it was an excellent take on a traditional meal, making the most of some very special seasonal ingredients in a way that would shame three out of four Iron Chefs. My more visceral take: \"yuummmmmy.\"\n\nWe debated whether or not to get dessert. Well, actually, we first debated whether Bistrot Zinc even served dessert. (\"Of course; we're French!\" said our server.) Then we pondered the menu, or more specifically we began the \"creme brulee or <i>anything</i> else\" argument.\n\nI settled on <i>millas du Bordeaux</i>, a dish involving caramel, pastry and a vanilla-cherry custard, which was delicious beyond all reason and not even all that heavy. (A good thing, since I had just eaten the French Hungry-Man plate.) Jenny got <i>profiteroles</i> with fresh vanilla ice cream and dark-roast chocolate sauce. \"It's very hard to do right. They did it at least right,\" she says.\n\nIt was a perfect evening meal. Well, if you don't consider the Mexican busguy who decided the best approach to refilling my water glass was to reach over my plate while I was eating. He's welcome to his own style, but...well, I was eating that and had hoped to continue eating it without interruption by a steel pitcher and accompanying arm.\n\nWe got out of there spending a week's worth of Jenny's tip money, and would have gone to the Oak/Rush Starchucks for a post-French digestive coffee. But they decided to be (scoff!) <i>regular</i> and close at 10 pm (scoff scoff!).\n\nSo after a quick trip to Virgin Megastore to use the restroom and buy Simpsons Monopoly (she won), we are now <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/shop/product.asp?category%5Fname=Coffee+Quick+Pick&product%5Fid=Aged+Sumatra\">drinking coffee at home</a>.\n\nEarlier, before going to the Bistrot, we finally got to visit Powell's Bookstore on Lincoln, where you can stay as long as you like, but you can't ever leave without buying something. There weren't as many disgraced bestsellers as at a far weirder secondhand bookstore we visited the day before (Monday), but Powell's is just as much a sketch for a surrealist movie set. And they even have a public restroom.\n\nWe walked in both carrying book bags and shopping bags, and yet we were not stopped or stared at, but rather given time and space to browse effectively. While I looked over their twenty-foot-high shelves of film books, the clerks (who are our age) were talking and there was not a single \"umm\" or similar vocal tic to be heard.\n\nWe also stopped at the Starbucks at Sheffield and Diversey, which stocks retail items (bar spoons, mugs) neither Jenny nor I had ever even heard of, and which had to be reminded what a Tazo Citrus was. It's a store that's been there longer than we have, and -- miraculously for a Starbucks in Chicago -- the staff has been there the whole time. (Unlike a store like Le Cafe d'Enfer, which goes through staff like water, so to speak.)"

    body: "The latest adventure at <i>Le Café d'Enfer</i>: celebrities are no stranger to <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/\">Starbucks</a> in Chicago; the former flagship store at Oak & Rush Streets claims second-tier actor/comedian Jeremy Piven as a regular, while the Starbucks on Chestnut Street claims to have served John Cusack and Neve Campbell.\n\nUntil this weekend, 670 North Michigan's only brushes with fame were our notoriously iffy lattes and a brief visit by R. Kelly some months ago. But that all changed when we were visited by one <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Name?McBride,+Chi\">Chi McBride</a>. That's right, TV's Principal Steven Harper! You know...from that show <i>Boston Public</i>? It's on Fox. Right before <i>Ally McBeal</i>. Still not ringing any bells? His previous roles include the lead on <i>The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer</i>...still nothing?\n\nWell, that's okay, since I don't watch the show either. Suffice to say, McBride is a lot less gruff and scowly out of character, but probably as imposing a presence. That is to say, while standing in the presence of Nicole Kidman would have me on my knees speaking to God, standing in the presence of TV's Chi McBride merely leaves one star-struck enough to ask for an autograph. Which I did not, although several co-workers did.\n\nWhen our assistant manager came out to survey the carnage, her only comment was: \"Didn't anyone think to ask him for an autograph for the store?\" Of course nobody did, although we all thought it was a great idea after the fact."

    body: "<b>\"Snark or da mammoth gets it! 'No! Not the tar pit! Nooo!'\"</b>\n<i>- Jenny, holding Mammoth (one of my stuffed toys) by the tail and lowering him slowly toward the mattress.</i>\n\nNever let it be said that the BBC doesn't go all-out with its epic literary miniseries, or that they're incapable of reducing said epic literacy to '<a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Details?0184135\"><i>The League of Gentlemen</i></a> meets <a href=\"http://www.lordoftherings.net/\"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a>'. <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Details?0197154\"><i>Gormenghast</i></a> features just about every Respected British Thespian you've ever heard of and many you should have, plus a member of the aforementioned League, and yet it doesn't have quite the grandeur it seems to aspire to.\n\nProbably because of scenes like the one I mentioned the other day (where Steve Pemberton runs around naked and screaming), or the fact that none of the Lords and Ladies of the House of Groan really come off as more than...well, they're fine in that grand old tradition of soap operas and class comedies, but their tragic fall seems to be waiting for a laugh line. Which, I suppose, is the point, but this is the BBC. Where is my classiness? Where is my grandeur!\n\nEpisodes One and Two are the strongest, detailing Steerpike's (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) rise from the kitchens (and escape from the odious cook, Swelter (Richard Griffiths)) to the working middle class as an assistant to various key courtiers, as well as the beginnings of his plan to start a revolution by killing off the Groans. In the first show, Titus Groan, the heir to the throne and son of the Earl of Gormenghast (Ian Richardson), is born. In the second episode, the Earl's library is burned down, he subsequently comes to believe he is an owl and kills himself (by owl, natch) and the infant Titus is crowned Earl.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, or trying to get at, is that the series works so much better before Titus Groan starts <i>talking</i>. He's just a whiny little ass; we don't care that he hates his station or tradition or even Steerpike. We really don't give a damn if he manages to fuck the Wild Girl, because he's such a nothing character and so totally upstaged by Rhys-Meyers, Celia Imrie, Christopher Lee, John Sessions, Fiona Shaw, Stephen Fry...need I go on? It's not that Cameron Powrie and Andrew Richardson (playing Titus at 12 and 17, respectively) are bad or less pedigreed performers. He's just a little ass of a character and I wanted to reach into the screen and slap him with a large herring. <a href=\"http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/FISH.GAME/notebook/fish/herring.htm\">No, larger.</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Name?McIntosh,+Neve\">Neve McIntosh</a> is all right as the mad Lady Fuchsia, who ages from 15 to 32 over the course of the series. It's not her fault that Rhys-Meyers plays Steerpike as a stock Charming Villain who (performancewise) is driven by his need to express himself through villainy more than his alleged feelings for Fuchsia. (Note to Steerpike: the way to a woman's heart is through her ring finger, stomach or lustful thoughts, <i>not</i> pet monkeys named <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Satan\">Satan</a>.)\n\n<a href=\"http://home.wish.net/~bhaarlem/starwars/personen/count_dooku.htm\">Christopher Lee</a> is even better in <i>Gormenghast</i> than in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and here he even plays a good guy. So what if he says more words in five minutes of <i>LOTR</i> than he does in this entire miniseries? Or that he dies a rather <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0081505\">Scatman Crothers-esque death</a> so that Whinyass (aka Titus) can step up and claim his birthright?\n\nSigh. What a waste."

    description: "I guess you had to have been there."
    body: "<b>\"It's Death! I can hear it squeaking!\"\n\"Headmaster Death!\"\n\"de Ath, man! Show some respect!\"</b>\n\nJenny bought me the DVD of <i>Gormenghast</i>, the epic BBC miniseries of Mervyn Peake's little-known literary classic, here reduced (or embiggened, depending on how you look at it) to something a little less <i>The Mists of Avalon</i> and more <i>The League of Gentlemen</i>. Not that there's anything wrong with that.\n\nJonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as the \"dangerous and charming kitchen boy\" Steerpike, who -- through a series of manipulations and ruthless assassinations -- rises from Richard Griffiths's kitchen/boudoir to the heights of power in the House of Groan (yes, Groan). His only threat comes from Titus (Andrew Robertson), the 77th Earl of Groan, who has succeeded his father, the dotty patriarch Sepulchrave Groan (Ian Richardson, not much better known as the alien leader in <i>Dark City</i>), only to find himself trapped squarely inside a small plastic box marked \"sullen teenage archetype, 2 for \$1\". (Oops, sorry -- make that £1.)\n\nStanding by going very dramatically insane are Titus's mother Lady Gertrude (ably played by fifty pounds -- I mean dollars -- of foam rubber and Celia Imrie), who talks to birds, and his sister Lady Fuchsia (Neve McIntosh), who has the unfortunate burden of being in love with Steerpike.\n\n(\"What's unfortunate?\" says Jenny. \"He's <i>cuuuute</i>.\")\n\nNot that Titus is problem-free himself -- he's in love with the Wild Girl, who is his sister only in the sense that her mother was Titus's wet nurse. Oh, and there's the twins -- Ladies Cora and Clarice (Lynsey Baxter, Zoe Wanamaker) who have enough brainpower between them to find their way out of a paper bag, but after that, pffft.\n\n<i>Gormenghast</i> is populated by a host (yes, a host!) of wacky supporting characters who inhabit the titular megacastle, from Flay, the terse manservant (Christopher Lee. [sound of crickets chirping] Um, Saruman? [murmurs of recognition]), the loquacious Dr. Prunesquallor (John Sessions) and his under-sexed sister Irma (Fiona Shaw), Nanny Slagg and a gaggle of schoolteachers living under the yoke of the frightfully senile Headmaster De Ath and led (grudgingly) by narcoleptic Professor Bellgrove (Stephen Fry).\n\nMy favorite scene is the one where Professor Mule (Steve Pemberton, one of the League of Gentlemen) is presented to Irma Prunesquallor, and upon seeing a woman for the first time in many, many years, reverts to his three favorite words (\"Bloody...booger...bastard!\") then collapses into a \"full spasm\". As Irma romances Bellgrove in the garden, Dr. Prunesquallor decides that the best therapy for the unconscious Mule is to cut away his clothes and gently tap his spine with a mallet.\n\nNext thing we know, Mule is running out of the house and through the garden screaming, sending Irma -- a woman who has been without the company of men for many a year -- into her own screaming fit. It's funny. Isn't it? <i>Isn't it?</i>\n\nI guess you had to have been there."

The latter part -- the bulk -- of the movie does nothing for me, but the first bit is golden.\n\nWell, that's not totally true -- I do like Miranda Richardson throughout the film, and I should probably take the time to watch the whole thing without commercial interruptions so I can find out what happens after Whitaker gets voted off. But the latter scenes are what's \"interesting;\" the former scenes are what's good.\n\nOkay. Done. Whew."

    description: "At least she didn't say \"Caramel Makita\"."
    body: "While walking home down Chicago's Magnificent Mile, I ran into a film teacher from last Spring, Tom Comerford (aka Commie). That I call him Commie should tell you something about how it looked to see him on the Mile, walking past Crate & Barrel and Cartier. He was probably on his way to the film lab, but only because Tom (a notorious do-it-yourselfer) hasn't yet figured out how to MacGyver color chemistry using vinegar, developing powder and Starbucks Tazoberry.\n\nLet's play a little game and see how many major brand names you can spot in the following paragraphs: Today's solution to the ongoing problem* of coming to work at Chicago's most visible (and most Corporate-ridden) Starbucks Coffee shop wearing days-old, smelly clothes: buy more clothes. I walked into the Gap half an hour before my shift and bought a complete change of clothes (except for pants, only because the Dockers Recodes I had on were perfectly acceptable, thankyouverymuch).\n\nThe shirt, socks and, yes, even underwear I walked into work wearing were removed, Febrezed and wrapped in three layers of plastic garbage bag. As a result, we had 20% fewer customer complaints about \"that guy -- who's doing a great job, don't get me wrong...it's just that, well, he smells like a gorilla.\" (We did, however, have 21% more complaints about \"that guy...he just fell asleep into his steaming pitchers...\")\n\nTonight's IFC Fridays on Bravo feature is <i>The Crying Game</i>, which I have never seen. It looks appropriately quirky and filmic, although I don't know how much I might get out of it, as I already know Dil (Jaye Davidson) is a man. Watching it, and having seen Davidson as a man (who still, nonetheless, looked like a woman) in <i>Stargate</i>, I see little visual cues that tell me something ain't quite usual with that broad.\n\nOne more observation: those customers who even deign to acknowledge that our cup sizes are not called 'small, medium and large', or are not named after composers (e.g., 'Verdi'), sometimes feel compelled to apply French pronunciation where it is not appropriate. A couple of obviously quasi-affluent and only slightly bourgeois girls came in, tastefully dressed in leather-jacket urban casual. Then one of them said \"Von-tee\". As with nearly everybody these days, I sharply but politely repeated her order using the correct pronunciation (\"Venn-tee\", anglicized from \"Veyn-tee\") and got the requisite nasty look. At least she didn't say \"Caramel Makita\"; I would have been forced to ask her to leave the establishment immediately."

    title: "Rage against the (espresso) machine"
    author: "ddemaree"
    description: "Speaking of horror stories, I have one."
    body: "Speaking of horror stories, I have one: this afternoon a woman had been standing at my bar for a very long time. I finally cleared the buffer on Der Labelmaker so I asked her what her drink was. She said she was waiting to order. She spoke with a raspy, half-dotty unsure voice. Her lower mouth had a very, very old scar on it. She was probably not homeless, definitely old, alone and not totally normal.\n\nI told her, as I tell everyone, that you don't order from me, you order from the registers, and I pointed to Caroline, Sammy and such. The registers. If I had had more energy, or had given myself more time to think, I would have asked her what she wanted, and then told her to go to the registers only to pay for it. But no, but that's fine, I thought. She'll just hop in line and I'll get her order and everything will be fine.\n \nThe woman reacted to my simple, bright, helpful instruction as if I had told her she couldn't keep her cat anymore, and she turned away. I thought she was turning to the registers. She walked towards the door. I was sure she was gonna turn into the roped-off line to get in the line to order. She kept walking, and too-long later she was walking out the door.\n \nBy that time I was making three or four drinks, and couldn't tell anyone to correct her, or go out there, or anything. I told her I couldn't take her order, because I couldn't, and she interpreted this as an eviction notice. \"The siren has spoken, it's time for you to go.\"\n\n(BTW, I followed my weekly ritual of programming my VCR to tape last night's <i>Survivor: Marquesas</i> to the letter <i>except</i>: I forgot to reset my VCR clock for Daylight Time, so in place of the pivotal (!) \"merge\" episode of Survivor, I have an hour of <i>C.S.I.</i> Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just...(puppy dog eyes, little kid voice) I wanned my Survivor. Waah.)\n \nLet's see, what else can I bitch about? I think I sold four or five pounds of beans tonight, which will certainly make my boss less annoyed with his onetime bean sales champ. (Why no longer the champ? I stopped caring when [name of other partner deleted] got my MUG Award. If I'm not going to get some cheap, petty recognition out of it, fuck it. If ten to fifteen pounds a week is underperforming, then call me a slacker. It's not like our customers at Le Hell have some burning need to find out what, exactly, is the difference between House Blend and Sumatra, and then to take a week's supply home. We -- Store Number 2548, 670 North Michigan -- are, to our customers, just one of ~100 Starbucks locations in metro Chicago, nearly 200 in the whole Chicagoland area, nearly 3000 in North America, every one of which will be trying to get them to take home some beans.\n \nOur business is our customers' <i>immediate</i> needs -- coffee and a sweet to make them feel awake and happy like good little consumers. That's what the third place is: we are not work or home, you have no responsibilities while you are here, this place is now, will always be now, will never be then or tomorrow. The third place is nowhere, and our success is based on our ability to be nothing to everybody. To just say yes -- there is no red tape in the third place, there is no anything, just nothing -- to smile and be polite and amusing but not *too* memorable. You know, the human equivalent to white noise.\n \nSide note: I've decided that adventure is, by definition, something you only appreciate looking back. I'm sure that all the Survivors *hate* living on rats and playing that damned game until they're sitting there, telling their last words to that last camera. Adventurous films or books or plays seem better after you've seen them than while you were watching, and adventurous people are compelling only *after* you've met them."

    body: "This just in:\n\nSome of you may have already noticed that the performance of our \nconnection to the Internet is sub-par today.  We are currently \nexperiencing a number connectivity problems with both of our ISPs and \nare actively working to resolve them as quickly as possible.\n\nThank you for your patience.\n-- \nNetwork Services\nThe Art Institute of Chicago\n\nToday (Tuesday, 26 Feb) was/will be a slow day for updates as the Art Institute's network provider is busy demonstrating how to make hundreds of college students squirm. Our internet access has been spotty or just nonexistent since yesterday evening, so to kill the time I'm working on perfecting the new Practicalmadness homepage and browsing through a couple years' worth of old work.\n\nI just ran across the last Demaree's World homepage I did before Practical came out in Fall 2000; it was actually pretty good, if self-absorbed, and had a better focus on content. (Of course, I had a better focus on just about everything 18 months ago. People, I need help.)\n\nWhen the internet comes back, I think I'll take a bunch of my old homepage designs and post them so everyone can see what a talented little shit I was. (I did also find my favorite picture of myself. As a baby.)\n\nLooking through these pages, I realize that all the incredible new things I'm wanting to do to Practical -- things so original, so daring -- have not only been done before, but by me. Every single element of Practical 2.0 appeared on this site in some form, at some point. (Well, except for user registration, but really -- what is the point of that?)"

    body: "In a <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/perspective/chi-0202170484feb17.story\">Chicago Tribune interview</a> last week, Ralph Nader -- yeah, him again -- is quoted saying...well, you read it:<b>Q. Would you have made an effective wartime president? </b>\nA. This war would never have happened had I been president, because for 30 years we have had an aviation safety group, and we have been urging the airlines to toughen cockpit doors and improve the strength of the locks, and they have been resisting for 30 years.<a href=\"/election2000/\">Just like I was saying</a> back during the 2000 campaigns, Nader really has no idea what he's talking about. The particular events of September 11 may have been prevented by better airline security, true, but that is <i>such</i> a short-sighted way to look at it. If we hadn't been hit by terrorists using airliners as missiles, it's not like the terrorists would have had to go home to Osama and say, \"well, gee, boss -- we can't take these four-inch box cutters onto the plane. I guess we can't destroy America after all.\"Oh, and let's not forget, Ralphie -- you would have been in office only eight months, working within a system that has survived on inertia and graft since before you were born. Could you have so totally overhauled airline security in just eight months that the 9/11 attacks would have been impossible? Probably not. If they had occurred anyway, despite your brilliant planning and noble intent, would you have been as prepared to go after the perpetrators as Bush, or even Gore?Sigh. Arrogance is always easier five months after the fact.<i>While typing up this latest anti-Nader screed, I happened to look back over my work from the fall of 2000, when Practical covered the presidential election in its usual half-assed manner. There's some funny stuff that is currently not linked to from any page on the site, so if you'd care to take a look, <a href=\"/election2000/\">click here</a>.</i>"

    body: "Tonight I had a woman come over to me at primary bar and say that\nshe had a problem with her cappuccino. \"What is the problem?\" he\nasked genially.\n \"This drink was half foam!\"\n \"Well, ma'am, yes, a cappuccino is half foam.\"\n\"I always order this drink, but it's never like this...\"\n\nShe showed me her cup, now emptied of foam and left only\nhalf-full of coffee and milk. \"Well, ma'am,\" he said, \"I don't know\nwhat to tell you. That's the recipe. If you'd like me to make you\nanother one I'll be happy to...\"\n\nShe walked off.\n\nLater in the evening a woman whose command of the English\nlanguage consisted solely of \" two small iced white chocolate\nmocha\" and \"refund!\" found out we had run out of white mocha. We\ngave her iced caramel machs instead, then she realized she had paid\nus more than the cost of the machs.\n\nThis was probably the most reasonable demand by a customer on a\nnight featuring a man who brought in a coupon for a \"free cup of\ncoffee\" and asked to speak to my manager when I wouldn't honor it.\nIt was a manufacturer's coupon issued by Philip Morris, and from\nthe typefaces and colors it seemed to probably have come from a\npack of Marlboros. It had a barcode. A supermarket might have taken\nit.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, \"I can't accept this.\"\n\"I see. Is that the company's policy or is this your policy?\"\n\nCarillo, the assistant manager, was standing beside me. \"It's my\npolicy,\" I said. \"Can I speak to a manager?\" said the man. \"I'm the\nmanager,\" said Carillo, \"and we can't accept this.\"\n\nIf the conversation had gone on longer, I would have added:\n\"Sir, it is not Starbucks' policy to accept any coupons not issued\nby Starbucks Coffee. If you would like to speak to our general\nmanager, his name is Aaron and he will be in tomorrow morning. He\nwill laugh in your face, but he will be here.\"\n\nThe gentleman took the coupon back, placed it in his wallet,\npaid for his coffee and walked away with a bemused smile."
