# Ando: Powerful blogging, content management and other crap #

Formerly known as Blrb, "ANDO" is the code name for a new blogging/content management app intended to, if nothing else, replace Movable Type as the CMS for practicalmadness.com, practical.cc and other sites. Perhaps you'd like to use it as well?

Further details are forthcoming. (The original announcement e-mail has been posted to the wiki.)
